pancasila_DESC;The Pancasila faith is a relatively new addition to the island of Borneo. Claiming to follow the teachings of their grand antediluvian leader Sukarno and acting more as a set of philosophical and political beliefs rather than a religion, its adherents believe themselves to be the true continuation of the Old World state of Indonesia. All Pancasila rulers consider themselves mere governors in a great Indonesia, regardless if they act independently or not. Those who believe in Pancasila claim that yang Maha Esa gave Sukarno the Five Principles and Thirty-Seven Commandments so that he could lead the people of Indonesia against the forces of wickedness who enslaved the people of Indonesia during his time and lead Indonesia into an age of peace and unity, which they could once again bring if they follow the Principles and Laws. Its followers are very tolerant of any monotheistic religion, seeing them as yet another aspect of yang Maha Esa and are quite charitable to the commoners as the Fifth Principle demands social justice for all Indonesians.;;;;;;;;;x

ahmadiyya_DESC;The Ahmadiyya are an Islamic messianic movement founded by Ahmad, who claimed to be the divinely appointed Promised Mahdi, revealing himself to the Muslims of India and promising to peacefully guide Islam to triumph. His goals were to restore Islam to their long-forgotten ways of peace and sympathy. The Ahmadiyya, his followers, at his word gave up the sword, and vowed to spread the true faith through peace and dialogue. Ahmad was succeeded by the Ahmadiyya Caliphs, who guided his followers and spread the faith around the world. Now, the Ahmadiyya stranded in the New World haven't given up their faith, nor their pacifist ways, and they hope to one day restore the true Caliphate and spread the word of Ahmad to all corners of the world, just as their Mahdi instructed.;;;;;;;;;x

sarna_pagan_DESC;Sarnaism is a folk religion practised primarily by the Kurukh and Munda peoples and spread throughout the Chota Nagpur plateau in eastern India. Claiming to be an ancient belief system existing since time immemorial, Sarnaism, known locally as Sarna Dhorom and to outsiders as the Religion of the Holy Woods, is a nature worshipping pagan faith largely detached from surrounding Hindu and Abrahamic religions. Though syncretism is commonplace, Sarnaists reject the Varna system and ignore any foreign religious texts, instead turning inwards, focusing on protecting and nurturing the nature around them. Having a vast and inconsistent amount of deities and spirits, the most frequently worshipped supreme creator is the Sun, known as Dharmes, a force of unquestionable good. The sacred Sarna grove is of especial importance, and it is believed the groves are the abode of Chala Pachchho, a powerful female deity commonly identified as a mother goddess of earth and nature. Once a year Sarnaists observe the Sarhul festival, a three day period of celebration in which adherents celebrate marriage between the Earth and the Sun and offer sacrifices to village deities.;;;;;;;;;x

The supreme deity of the Sarna religion is the Sun god Dharmes, who is believed to be the force of unquestionable good in the world, hampered only by human vices. Sarnaists believe that the Old World was struck down by Dharmes as punishment for mankind's destruction of nature, and consider it their main duty to preserve and protect nature from those who wish to exploit and destroy it. Once a year Sarnaists observe the Sarhul festival, a three day period of celebration in which priests called Pahan offer sacrifices to the mother goddess Chala Pachchho and ancestral spirits, celebrating marriage between the Earth and the Sun.;;;;;;;;;x

qingzhen_DESC;Islam in China goes by many names - "Orthodox religion", "Cubic religion" or simply "Hui religion", but one word that is used by its followers to exemplify its virtues is "Qingzhenjiao", or the "Pure and True Religion". Due to its isolation from the wider ummah by successive Chinese governments, the Muslims of China have adopted peculiar practices influenced by the local Confucian and Daoist philosophies and other new Chinese religious traditions, such as ancestor veneration and a generally Confucian social outlook. In fact, many Muslims in China consider Confucius on par with the Prophet Muhammad, dubbing him the "Sage of the East" as opposed to the Prophet's status as the "Sage of the West". They will often translate Islamic concepts using Confucian terminology, culminating in the near-syncreticism of Confucianism and Islam present in many of their religious works, such as the Han Kitab, or the use of Taoist clothes by certain members of their Sufi orders.;;;;;;;;;x

akjang_DESC;Ak Jang is an indigenous religion that flourished among the Altai people of Russia's Altai Republic during the 1900s. The Russian Empire was suspicious of the movement's potential to stir up native unrest and perhaps involve outside powers and thus suppressed it. The religion was originally millenarian, charismatic and anti shamanic, the movement gradually lost most of these qualities becoming increasingly routine, institutionalized and accommodating itself to the pre existing Altaian folk religion. It is derived from a combination of Tengriism, Buddhism and Khurmaztism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Church used this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to seize control of the former state of Utah, turning it into the newly-established Kingdom of Deseret. Tensions quickly began to rise, however, between the Church and the more fundamentalist groups of Mormon society, with many under the President demanding a return to the old ways, repealing various reforms passed after the Presidency of Joseph Smith, such as the abolition of polygamy and theodemocracy. The Church did not budge, and tensions finally boiled over in the year 2133, when the newly-proclaimed Brighamites rioted in Temple Square, causing a standoff that ended with its destruction and the excommunication of all who dare call themselves Brighamite.;;;;;;;;;x

brighamite_DESC;Wishing for a return to what they consider the true Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the fundamentalist elements of Mormon society after the Event united under the name of Brigham Young, whom they consider the last true President. The Brighamites reject many of the newer reforms of the LDS Church, allowing men to marry multiple women, as well as reinforcing the political aspects of theodemocracy, which they consider instrumental in building up the Kingdom of God, something the mainstream Church believes refers to spiritual matters such as proselytisation. Unable to cause any permanent change in the Church, a large Brighamite mob in 2133 rioted in Temple Square, destroying the complex and getting excommunicated as a result. In the years since, those who still call themselves Brighamite were forced out of Salt Lake City and into the outskirts of Deseret and Mormon society as a whole, though the Brighamites have never stopped wishing for a Zion free from liberal reforms.;;;;;;;;;x

omniaveritatis_DESC;The trauma of the Event was ruthless to the Church, stranded far away from their Pope. The few surviving Catholic communities of the Pacific Northwest soon got overtaken by those wishing to prevent the wayward masses from turning to paganism, as many around them have done. Thus started the inquisition against folk saints and anything perceived as heresy. Very soon, these revivalist Catholics started exclusively celebrating the Tridentine Mass, and many started considering Latin a holy language, one in which the Holy Spirit speaks through the faithful. The most zealous of them started conversing exclusively in Latin, and in a short timeframe entire communities had abandoned their mother languages in place of one that had before been considered dead for millennia. Now, the believers in "Omniaveritatis", or the "All-Truthers" to those who do not speak their alien language, believe that the Last Pope ascended to Heaven during the Event, so he may return on Judgement Day to lead his faithful to battle against heathens alongside Jesus Christ himself. As such, they have become very militant in their beliefs, considering those around them to be barbaric heathens.;;;;;;;;;x

doukhobor_DESC;The Doukhobors or "spirit-fighters" are the pacifistic Spiritual Christians of the forested hinterlands of Beecy. Supposedly the descendants of ancient Russians who fled to the New World long before the Event, their religion is one of divine revelation on the individual level, believing that more important than any scripture or priestly guidance is personal contact with God. Their belief is that God dwells in every human being, and so rather than reading the Bible they pass down hymns and psalms orally, in a practice they call "the Living Book". Doukhobor society is generally communal, believing that every man is equal as all have God within them.;;;;;;;;;x
indian_shaker;Indian Shaker;;;;;;;;;x
indian_shaker_DESC;The Indian Shaker Church traces its heritage long before the Event. According to tradition, the Squaxin holy man Squ-sacht-un, also known as John Slocum, was killed in a logging accident on Skookum Inlet. During his wake, he sprung back to life, claiming that God had sent him to deliver a message to the Indian people - to stop smoking, drinking, and gambling, and instead seek Jesus. At the site of his resurrection, his newfound followers erected the first Indian Shaker church. The religion gets its name from the vigorous shaking its adherents do during prayer, believing it to be a source of healing powers. Indian Shakers believe that John Slocum was saved from a serious illness by his wife Mary, who had received the power of Jesus to cure disease as she began to shake, and she shook her body over John until he miraculously healed. Indian Shakers also do not read the Bible, instead believing in the power of gospel and direct revelations from God. Their churches are humble and plain, adorned with many handbells and crosses, though they seldom observe classic sacraments, their services instead consisting of bell-ringing, praying, and loud stomping.;;;;;;;;;x

Founded long before the Event by the Wanapum prophet Smohalla, who had died while travelling the Americas and was brought back to life by God. He led a return to the old ways of life of his people, reintroducing ceremonial music and dancing. His followers, the Dreamers, respect and follow the ways of their ancestors as well as the weyekin, the spirits of the land. They hold that God created people and Mother Earth, who gives the people plants and animals for food, so the Dreamers demand respect for the Earth they live on, refusing to buy or sell land as if it were a commodity. The prophets of the Dreamers commune with the spirit world through prophetic dreams, which are brought on by the signature Spirit Dance, through the playing of drums, ringing of brass bells, and ecstatic dancing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

scholastic_DESC;The Scholastic Universalists are a deistic religion that developed out of the many university towns of the East Coast. Though it doesn't have a single orthodox creed, its adherents are unified in a single goal - a search for God by means of rationale, philosophy, and observation. The greatest Scholastics spend many years studying, researching faiths both familiar and exotic, and travelling far and wide in search of spiritual growth and answers many would consider unanswerable. The questioning of faith itself is heavily encouraged, and very little authority or hierarchy can be found among Scholastic Universalism, save for the Council of Deans, which organises and directs different universities in search for Old World knowledge.\nThus, in many ways, Scholastic Universalism resembles a grandiose research project more than it does a religion - temples are replaced by universities and libraries, time spent praying is instead spent with nose in books, and pilgrimage sites are decided on a personal level. These Scholastics have slowly but surely amassed what is considered the greatest collection of knowledge since the Event, one that is still slowly but surely growing in an endless search to understand God through any means necessary, be it through esoterica or through research and observation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

myriadic_DESC;Myriadic Witchcraft worships no gods, and no masters. Though the followers of this school of witchcraft do not question nor deny the existence of gods, many worshipping different deities as they please, they also do not believe the gods of this world have any major influence on it. Rather, Myriadic witches draw their power and magick from Logos, the Word (and thus, the Will) of the universe. Logos manifests on Earth in many different forms, such as through the study of Qabalah, the proper application of astrology, or through elaborate and difficult to deciper manuscripts. Myriadic witches particularly enjoy studying chaos magick, and believe the more a person focuses on their belief in magick and the world around them, rather than worshipping gods, the more powerful their magick becomes. Myriadic witches also have a particular disregard for authority in all forms, believing organised religion to be the bane that wipes out all belief in magick wherever it goes.;;;;;;;;;x

illustrious_DESC;The Students of the Illustrious Path are worshippers of the one supreme God, who transcends the universe. Though known by many names - Shangdi, Ishvara, Waheguru - God is absolute. The Illustrious Path and its Students are named for their belief in maya, the illusion of reality, a formless veil separating the human soul from oneness and conscious knowledge of the Absolute. They believe the absolute self and God are one and the same, though separated by bad karma and ignorance. Thus, his Students embark on the Illustrious Path, a lifelong path of learning and love in order to escape the eternal cycle of life and death and reunite with God in the Realm of Truth. Because God is formless and beyond human comprehension, his Students' love and devotion are directed towards the emanations of God that exist in the Court of the Lord, the primary one being the Illustrious Triune, who is the purest manifestation of God. The Illustrious Triune is the source of life and has three distinct aspects - the Heavenly Father, the Heavenly Mother, and the Honourable Guru. The Father rules the Celestial Bureaucracy and all the souls liberated from moksha, the Mother rules and is one with the Earth, and the Guru reincarnates in the mortal world to guide mortals on the Illustrious Path. Many historical figures are identified as the Guru by the Students, such as Laozi, Buddha, Jesus, and Guru Nanak, though they believe the next cycle of gurus is not to begin until the end of Kali Yuga.;;;;;;;;;x

dianic;Dianic;;;;;;;;;x
dianic_DESC;Dianic Witchcraft focuses on the worship of the Goddess, a single great female deity whom they consider the creator of all life, as well as the primordial form of many different goddesses throughout many traditions and religions. The Great Goddess is one with the world - her divine energy flows through every living creature, and the whole Earth is simultaneously a piece of the Great Goddess.\nThe manifestations of the Goddess come in many different forms, but the most widely worshipped is that of the Triple Goddess - a divine trinity composed of the Maiden, associated with youth, the Mother, associated with the birth of life, and the Crone, associated with wisdom. Those who worship the Triple Goddess consider her to be an archetype that is personified through many different names and representations throughout history. The most common goddesses worshipped are Diana, associated with the Maiden, Gaia, associated with the Mother, and Hecate, associated with the Crone. Other less worshipped but nonetheless present deities include Selene, who is the personification of the Moon, and Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld.\nThe worshippers of the Goddess do not worship any male gods, believing that the pre-Event world was struck down by the Great Goddess as a result of her neglect. Dianic witches prefer to gather and worship in nature, which they consider a sacred gift from Mother Gaia. They are no strangers to casting spells and rituals to receive boons from their goddesses, though cursing others is generally looked down upon.;;;;;;;;;x

templarist_DESC;The Templarists take their name from an ancient order of Christian knights, rumoured to have been destroyed by the enemies of God centuries ago, its last leaders ascending to Heaven to fight in the Lord's army. Calling themselves protectors and loyal knights of old America, the Dominionists of the post-Event world quickly came to realise that soon there will be no America left to turn into the Kingdom of God. The prevailing belief became that it is upon the return of the Lord Jesus Christ that the true America will be rebuilt, ruled by the faithful under Biblical law. However, in order for Christ to return, he must be called upon by sacrifice, and reborn into a new mortal shell. Thus, the Templarists vow to call the Lord back to Earth by spilling the blood of infidels, the very same blood that Jesus will use to be reborn. The infidels that are killed are quickly baptised in order to cleanse their body and soul, so their blood may be pure enough for Jesus and the soul may ascend to Heaven's gates instead of suffering eternal torment. These loyal knights of America have vowed to never end their mission until their Lord returns and takes them into Heaven.;;;;;;;;;x

dominionist_DESC;Dominion theology believes that America is a Christian nation, ruled by God's children and God's laws. However, the Dominionists of the post-Event world have found themselves in endless conflict with their Templarist brothers, who believe that America will be restored by Jesus Christ upon his return, and have taken it upon themselves to advance his return through the spilling of oceans of blood. The Dominionists find this belief appalling, instead insisting that it is the duty of every man who calls himself Christian to restore America, for Jesus will not return as long as America lies in ruin and paganism. Nonetheless, they are still divided on the many questions of Dominion theology, and stand far from united against the Templarist heresy.;;;;;;;;;x

arcadian_DESC;Arcadian Witchcraft worships the Horned God, an omnipresent deity that represents the divine masculine of the universe. They believe that the Horned God personifies himself as many different gods throughout history, though every god can be traced back to an interpretation of the Horned God's divine will. The Arcadians most faithfully worship Pan, the satyr god of nature, mountains, the wilderness, as well as dryads and shepherds. They believe that Pan created the Earth in the form of a utopia called Arcadia, where every man was free to do as he wills, a world full of frolic and merriment. However, the greed and ambition of man led to the creation of giant states of decay and machines of destruction, and Arcadia was ultimately burned down in the Event. Now, the Arcadians are staunch protectors of what they believe to be the last scraps of a lost utopia - the Pacific Northwest. They believe that all of nature - from the rocks to the trees and the wildlife - contains divine spirits bestowed to it by the Horned God. Bustling woods, towering mountains, and endless wildlife, the Arcadians are the ones who keep careful watch for wildfires and those seeking to do nature harm, believing it is their duty to appease the spirits of nature and keep the mankind in harmony with the remnants of Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;x

Formally monotheistic, Balinese worship is focused primarily on a supreme being called Acintya, also known as Sang Hyang Tunggai or Sang Hyang Widi Wasa. Worship of the Trimurti is commonplace, whom they consider to be manifestations of Acintya, occasionally identified as Shiva or Siwa-Sadasiwa-Paramasiwa.

girondist_DESC;The predecessor to later Jacobinism in postdeluvian Europe, the Girondists are a deistic faith which believes that the many gods of Europe are merely individual facets of a singular greater God. They believe that man was created in the image of God mentally and spiritually, but not physically. Monarchs are those chosen by god before birth to rule, however should a monarch fail in his duties as a king, or worse, become a tyrant, the third estate is obligated to either dethrone him or, if they are a tyrant, feed him to Madame Guillotine. The three Archangels of the Creator are Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity who intercede on the behalf of the Creator, helping the peasantry and telling them when a ruler has lost his divine right to rule. The religion was once fairly widespread in France, however in the centuries since it has seen assimilation of Novelist gods into its pantheon. Unlike its more aggressive Jacobinist descendant present in secret academic societies, it is relatively peaceful, hence its ability to assimilate into Novelist society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

kalikula_DESC;Kalikula, meaning "Family of Kali" is the name for the Shaktist tradition of Kali worship most prevalent in northeastern India. Worship is focused on the goddess Kali as the main and most important manifestation of Brahman. Influenced by the teachings of the pre-Event guru Ramakrishna, modern Kali worship largely emphasises devotion (bhakti) over ritual, and as a result brahmin influence has greatly dropped after the Event. Other than Kali, worshipped deities include the Mahavidyas, Kaumari, Chandi, Durga, and many more regional gods and goddesses. Kali as the Supreme Being is considered both the loving mother of her children and their fierce guardian, and by extent the destroyer of evil. Worship is most often communal and carried out through festivals such as Kali Puja.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

orleanist_DESC;Arcenciste, colloquially called Jeannism is a heathen offshoot of Catholicism that has a cult-like following of Jeanne d'Arc, "the Maid of Orleans" amongst other saints, it was once much more common across France but has since been largely subsumed by Novelism. Jeanne led France to victory against the Queen's worshippers long before the Event in the fabled Siege of Orleans. According to legend, she was given the sword Joyeuse by Marianne, the guardian angel of France, which she used to smite the Queen's worshippers at Orleans. Vengeful, the followers of the Queen made a pact with the Devil, deceiving the Pope into branding Jeanne as a witch for which she was murdered. Though since canonised as a Saint, her loyal followers have not forgotten about this trickery and swear revenge against the wicked Queen and her worshippers, who have once again invaded their precious homeland, and therefore the Arcencists promise to cleanse France in the name of the Maid of God once more. Opinions on this religion vary, with both Catholics and Sevillians considering them heathen pseudo-pagans yet cautiously supportive of their crusade, while all those who worship the Queen are engaged in permanent hostility with the Arcenciste faithful. The religion has seen a resurgence under the Thelemite ruled regions of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dahatatta_DESC;Deha Tatta, meaning "truth in the body", is the name of the central theme and purpose of the songs of the Bauls. Bauls are the mystic troubadours of eastern India, who perform enigmatic songs and spread a message of love. Their music and poetry, called Baul sangeet, preaches about finding relationship with God and achieving spiritual liberation, seeking divinity within each person. They believe one should always be searching for Moner Manush - the "Man of their Heart", or the divine spirit of God manifested inside the body. Followers of Deha Tatta are as such devoted to Sadhana, the spiritual practice of transcending material things through purified love and devotion. The Bauls themselves come from various backgrounds, both from within the religion and from neighbouring religions like Islam and Hinduism. This act of coming together to preach love and mysticism has resulted in a unique blend of religions that has taken over Bengal since the Event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

raelian_DESC;Raëlism traces its roots back to the mythical pre-Event prophet known as Raël. The religion teaches that humanity was designed and created by an extraterrestrial race known as the Elohim. This was revealed to Raël by one of these creatures named Yahweh, who explained to him the truth of the universe. Claiming to be the leader of the Elohim and the creator of humanity, he reveals that, throughout all of history, he had created a total of 40 Elohim-human hybrids on Earth, who served humanity as prophets - among them being The Buddha, Jesus Christ, Muhammad, and Joseph Smith, with Raël himself being the 40th and final prophet. Raëlians claim that the world entered its current age, the Age of Destruction, in the pre-Event year of 1945, with an event called "the Atomic Bombing", in which a faraway planet called Hiroshima was annihilated by a great explosion caused by humans, after which humanity turned on each other and became dedicated to its own destruction, culminating in the Event itself and their near-total extinction. Raëlians engage in daily meditation, hope for physical immortality through human cloning, and promote a liberal ethical system with a strong emphasis on sexual experimentation, drawing the ire of many of its more traditionalist neighbouring religions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bahai_DESC;The Bahá'í Faith is a faith based on the teachings of the antediluvian prophets Báb, and his successor Bahá'u'lláh. They believe in a universalist world view of religion, claiming that there is one God, who is incomprehensible, and whose will has been and will be manifested throughout time in an endless series of revelations and theophanies given to the prophets of man. These Manifestations of God have been revealed to prophets progressively throughout history, unifying humanity in purpose, with interpretations differing according to societal needs. As a result, the Bahá'í are ardent advocates of world peace and unity, with their single greatest goal being that of a single world order where everyone can prosper, regardless of their race, nation, or beliefs.;;;;;;;;;x
baptist;Free Baptist;;;;;;;;;x
baptist_DESC;The Free Baptist Convention was formed after the Event by primarily the various black Protestant churches in the American South though other churches also joined, the most notable of which being the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the National Baptist Convention. Strongly influenced by figures such as Richard Allen, MLK, and abolitionist figures, but most importantly, the Social Gospel, the Convention is extremely diverse, both in beliefs and adherents. The Free Baptist Convention does not forget its roots in slavery, and as such has a rigorous, almost doctrinal emphasis on the civil rights of its citizenry, as well as charity and general pacifism, believing it is every man's duty to bring the Kingdom of Heaven to the world through good deeds and standing up for the voiceless.;;;;;;;;;x

Having no formal priestly hierarchy, or priests at all for that matter, the Bezpopovtsy completely reject even what little authority the First Hierarch has, instead holding local sermons with the position of priest being most often filled by family or village patriarchs. This lack of organisation has led to the festering of some heterodox practices, such as local scripture, local spirit worship, and most egregiously, self-immolation.;;;;;;;;;x

These Hermandades are recognised by their characteristic robes and capirotes in long processions through the streets every day of the week. The confraternities themselves are secretive in nature, though any Catholic is allowed to join given they participate in the flagellation required of them. Though the Penitentes have held influence in New Mexico for centuries before the Event, their popularity grew after the fact, many Catholics believing the apocalypse to be a sign from God that humanity has not suffered enough for their sins. Thus, many who believe in the Penitente are also a part of them, their peaceful ways in stark contrast to their scarred bodies.;;;;;;;;;x

osvicenism_DESC;A faith originating in the wake of the event in the previously extremely atheistic nation of Czechia, Osvicenism is a fusion of both Christian and Buddhist beliefs which had grown significantly in popularity within the nation. Founded by a Czech Buddhist Monk who had been raised a Catholic, he found a way to unite his disparate beliefs together under one system which appealed to the people across Czechia and Goralia. Later this system of belief would spread east by several Monks to the Buddhists of Kalmykia, converting many and becoming a stronghold of the faith. It espouses that while it was to the Buddha that God revealed how one may ascend to heaven, it was only available to the most ascetic of monks, it was only through the sacrifice of Christ that this pathway was made open to all. It views sins such as Pride or Lust as faults which must be overcome by meditation on their meaning and the emotional state which they cause. Only by conquering these faults across multiple lifespans may a person purify themselves and therefore escape the cycle of Birth, Death, Purgatory and Rebirth which all but the most ascetic monks are trapped within. Those ascetics are close to fulfilling their escape to heaven where they will join God as saints.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It awaits the arrival of the Lord of Light and wishes to take control of China to prepare the way for his arrival. Moni is believed to have been the most recent reincarnation of the Lord of Light, other reincarnations include the Buddha, Zoroaster and Jesus. Devout practitioners of this faith practice a vegetarian diet.

wuist_DESC;Wujiao refers to the various shamanic religious traditions of the Sinitic populations of China. Chinese shamanism is intrinsic to Chinese folk religion and is fairly diverse. Various rituals and traditions are rooted in this belief system, such as Ritual Masters being identified as Wu by outsiders, though most adherents don't self-identify as such. In addition, Daojiao developed partially from Wujiao, as it focused around the pursuit of a long life, or the status of becoming a Xian, otherwise known as a holy man. Having been suppressed and stigmatized in pre-Event China, the religion post-Event had experienced a small revival but remains heavily fragmented. Wuists have generally opted to remain outside of the Daojiao-Liehuo-Sanminshuyi debate regarding the war in Heaven.;;;;;;;;;x

Although initially hesitant to participate in the Daojiao-Liehuo-Sanminzhuyi debate, the Reformed Wuists are now actively engaging in such matters.

These are pirates & cutthroats that have stricken fear in the hearts of all that found themselves at the wrong end of a cutlass. According to them, in distant Nassau, the Code of the Sea was drafted by the legendary Flying Gang to manage the savagery of the sea at the dawn of a new age. Indeed, the Buccaneers consider themselves among the very last free people in all the world, living by the final code of laws said to have been drafted prior to the Event, the single aspect of their way of life which distinguishes them from lesser sea-raiders. The Code of the Sea makes no pretense that it codifies anything else besides the customs of pirates, but it is a code which every pirate of the Golden Age of Piracy is said to have had a say in its creation, and accordingly serves as the first tome of holy laws drafted through a democratic fashion. Indeed, even the most powerful captain in the Seven Seas knows that he only rules with the approval of his crew. Today, any who swear upon Neptune's honor may enter into this loose brotherhood as new men, unfettered by all other laws except for those which deal with matters of ship and sail, and to unravel the mysteries of the deep sea and bring succor to those who desire life upon the seas. Indeed, it is said that the fabled Republic of Pirates, the mythical kingdom in which all men were free to do as they please, was the first meritocracy in all the world, will one day be established again once the insidious powers which destroyed it are scoured from the Earth.;;;;;;;;;x

What came after was total church reform, or rather, the strengthening of its power in the political spotlight. The Patriarchate seized Mexico City and soon started enacting policies of mass religious education, cracking down on public worship of folk saints and syncretic deities, and other similar measures in order to safeguard the Church from heresy and collapse. To the more progressive priests of the Church, these measures were no short of an inquisition, and the pressure boiled over in 2281 AD, when the Mexican Catholic Church officially schismed into two - one half following the Patriarch as the rightful representative of Rome in Mexico, and the other electing their own Archbishop of Mexico City, one with a lot less power, and consequently, a lot less unity.;;;;;;;;;x

They believe that the world was created by two supreme deities - the organic was created by Gaia, the Mother Nature, and the inorganic was created by God, the Father Industry. In this dualistic balance, the two deities have been in conflict with each other since time immemorial. It was not until Mother Nature created the ultimate invention - life - that one side got the upper hand in this conflict, and the natural world spread without limit, taking over and controlling the inorganic. Industrialists believe that Father Industry then created his own form of life, by crafting the first humans out of clay. He gave them the gifts of thought and intelligence, and taught them how to make fire and how to craft. Thus humanity, the children of the Father, prevailed over Mother Nature, and spread his gifts of metal across the world, creating massive Titans of destruction, flying contraptions, and sky towers. It was not until the ultimate deceit revealed itself - the Black Gold gifted by the Father to power his creation was organic, and when its source was cut off and diminished, the world of man collapsed. Nature took its revenge, leading man to near extinction. Now the world was returned to how it was in the beginning, and the remaining sons of the Father scavenge the ruins of their forefathers, searching for their Lord's gifts and the methods needed to rebuild what is rightfully theirs.;;;;;;;;;x

macabrist_DESC;When the Event shook the world to its core, many felt abandoned by their gods. The wayward New English masses got swept by many newfound lodges, occult rituals, and societies preaching freedom of will and body. Whereas the lodges of the north found solace in the sanctity of nature, the lodges of the south instead grew fearful of the dark forces beyond this world, believing the very carelessness displayed is what led to the destruction of the first world. Sacrifices and prayers to the unknown evils grew into elaborate rituals, and the denouncing of lavishness turned into witch hunts for those deemed too sinful, the masses fearing acceptance of such behaviour will lead to mankind's demise once again.\nThe primary belief of the Macabrists is that of The One, the supreme creator. The One is a being beyond human comprehension, credited with being the architect of the universe, the creator of life, and the source of all energy, but also the source of all evil, creating the Devil and his macabre creations. The One is generally believed to have three main aspects - The Light which brightens the world, The Sun as the source of all warmth, and The Word as the source of all knowledge. Thus, The One has many representations, both male and female, including that of the Christian God, Gaia the Triple Goddess, and The Horned God of the Hunt.\nNow, the laypeople of the Macabrist Churches are encouraged to live humble, simple lives, seeking to enter Heaven and reunite with The One who gave them life, while the priests and priestesses most versed in "the Craft" cast magical rituals and wards to keep the mortal world free from the Devil's machinations, unknowable evils seeking to drag souls into hellfire. Black cats, broken mirrors, ravens, and other displays of "bad luck" are considered to open portals to the underworld, leaving people open to demonic possession.;;;;;;;;;x

quaker_DESC;The Old Order Anabaptists are a branch of traditionalist Anabaptist communities that have preserved the traditional lifestyles of their ancestors, such as the Amish, the Old Order Mennonites, and the Hutterites. Their insistence on traditional way of living dates back centuries before the Event and extends not just to social traditions, but reliance on technology, as well as their way of governing. These rules, called the Ordnung, extend to every facet of life, and include dress codes, an insistence on pacifism, the shunning of regular usage of complex and especially Old World technology, as well as insisting that kings rule according to the Bible, not according to Old World documents and constitutions.\nContrary to popular belief, technology use is not prohibited, though the extent of its usage largely depends on community. This wary outlook on progress is the primary factor that helped the Old Order Anabaptists survive the Event relatively well, with them quickly adapting to the new way of post-Event life, and building some of the most stable and prosperous kingdoms of the early post-apocalyptic era. However, the world is progressing faster than the Old Order Anabaptists can keep up, and their way of life finds itself threatened once more.;;;;;;;;;x

celtic_pagan_DESC;A wide set of folk beliefs formed after the Event with influences from Christianity and various occult movements, the Arboreal faith believes that the universe and everything in it was created by a single God - a Great Architect, and from his energy emanated all living things. The first life was given to Gaia, Mother Nature, and in her image came the creation of the first humans and the great garden surrounding them. In this garden, however, man was deceived by the Devil, and this corruption of energy led to the creation of many aeons of God, great cosmic beings that never left and still prey on humanity. Man's pride and hubris tested their patience, and the world was struck down as punishment for their arrogance. Now, after the deluge, the Arboreal orders of druids seek to preserve the world as it was designed by the Divine Mother, with regular offerings and sacrifices both to the lesser gods in service of the Architect, and to the Old Ones to keep them away and prevent another apocalypse.;;;;;;;;;x

genevist;Genevist;;;;;;;;;x
genevist_DESC;Genevism is a Calvinist movement founded, according to legend, right after the Event during the reign of Emperor Jürgen the Holy. The Genevists are named after the Council of Geneva, in which all Calvinist priests in Europe attended. The Council announced the proclamation of the Calvinist Theocracy as the official form of governance for the Alpereich, which caused a number of priests to storm out, leading to their excommunication and the subsequent founding of the Genevese Church. Following this schism, the Genevese Church eventually took more radical stances regarding Calvinist politics, advocating for total separation of the realm of God and the realms of men. According to the Genevese, all of God's laws cannot be realistically enforced on Earth, and as such Theocracy cannot be the ideal way to govern as it is fundamentally flawed. Though their popularity has waned in the years after the Council, relegating them to near obscurity, Genevese thought may yet be revived once theocratic rule fails the Calvinist faithful.;;;;;;;;;x

haymanot_DESC;This distinct sect of Judaism, practiced by the Betah Israeli Jews of Ethiopia has too survived the Event. Their Biblical texts have a few additions to the usual Jewish Bible.

zoroastrian_DESC;Zoroastrians worship Ahura Mazda, the uncreated God, as proclaimed by the ancient Iranian prophet Zoroaster. It was the official religion of all Persian empires (except the Hellenic Seleucid Empire) until the Muslim conquest of the Sassanid Empire in 651. The ancient form of the religion involved great sacred hill top fires and the exposure of dead bodies to scavenger birds for cleansing, while the modern form of this religion instead mainly focuses on the following of its primary creed, "Good Thoughts, Good Deeds, Good Words." As such, they are very generous and charitable despite the fact their religion has seriously declined in its number of adherents. The two largest surviving communities can be found in central Iran and Western India, though there was an attempt at revival in the Yarsani Kingdom of Kurdistan in recent history.;;;;;;;;;x
GOD_ZORVAN;Zorvan;;;;;;;;;x
neo_zorvanite;Neo-Zorvanite;;;;;;;;;x
neo_zorvanite_DESC;Based on a collection of texts uncovered by a Zoroastrian Priest in late 23rd century Tajikistan. This faith holds that the god of time Zorvan is father to both Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu and that Zorvan guides humans destiny through various celestial implements. One key difference between this sect and its ancient forebearer is that it contends that Humans must have free will otherwise the command by Ahura Mazda to do good is pointless, thus a divine being would not state such. The faith looks slightly more favourably on Angra Mainyu than traditional Zoroastrianism due to him being one of Zorvan's sons. Additionally they believe that Zorvan's sons must both exist for there to be a universal balance, they believe that there can be no good without evil and no order without chaos to compare it to, while Ahura Mazda is the sibling worthy of worship Angra Mainyu should be respected for the role he plays in the natural order of Zorvan's weave. Because of these beliefs it was driven from its Tajik homeland by its fellow Zoroastrians and the religion found popularity amongst the Sarikoli. The religion generally speaking is not aggressive and if not for it's aggressive neighbours would continue residing amongst its mountain tribes.;;;;;;;;;x 
koranist;Qurani;Qurani;Qurani;;Qurani;;;;;;;;;x
koranist_DESC;Dating back to the early days of Islam, the Qurani believe that Islamic law and guidance should only be based on the Koran, thus opposing any religious authority of the hadiths as well as caliphs. It is their belief that God's message in the Koran is clear and complete as is and that it can be fully understood without referencing outside scriptures. In the post Event era, the Qurani are heavily persecuted and often branded as apostates. They themselves view other Muslims as corrupted and seek to bring Islam back to its original form.;;;;;;;;;x
pusaka;Pusaka;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pusaka_DESC;Pusaka, meaning Heirloom, is a term for a new syncretic school of Sunni that has only relatively recently gained a widespread following in the lands of old Indonesia. Born from a combination of Islam and various Indonesian and Malay native beliefs, spirituality, mysticism and shamanism have an important role in the Pusaka faith. Shamans, known as the dukun to Indonesians and the bomoh to the Malay, have an important role in society, considered to be healers and diviners. Weather shamans, known as the pawang, are believed to control the weather and tame wild beasts. There is a special emphasis on ancestral heirlooms, which are believed to house the spirits of ancestors and must be protected, and can give their owners extraordinary powers. Other than venerating the spirits of ancestors, the Pusaka also believe in a wide variety of supernatural entities, ranging from ghosts, known as the hantu, to imps, goblins, and familiars. Despite incorporating a large amount of native beliefs and being denounced by mainstream Muslims as blasphemers and profaners, the Pusaka still firmly consider themselves Muslim, believing that only a powerful and pious Sultan can firmly unite Nusantara once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

syafi_DESC;Pesantreni is an Islamic sect originating in Nusantara. It is named after the "pesantren", a type of religious school which played a major role in the spread of Islam within the region. Largely the same as pre-Event orthodox Sunni Islam, the Pesantreni sect has managed to largely avoid internal religious conflict and major distortions to theology in ways of local Malay folklore. Despite outward insistence on religious cohesion and Shafi'i legalism, private worship of Pesantreni Islam tends to have many esoteric Sufist and mystic rituals, including the veneration of ancestral and nature spirits and the religious consumption of cannabis. Nonetheless, the Pesantreni sect still stands tall as the most powerful faith in Nusantara, a position that comes with a theological battle against the syncretic Pusaka sect, a faith which threatens to erase Pesantreni way of life from the history books.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
navayana;Navayana;;;;;;;;;x
navayana_DESC;Navayana is a school of Buddhism founded in the decades leading up to the event. Its founder, Bhimrao Ambedkar was born a Hindu, but however following his study of the Buddha's teachings he became convinced of its truth. He found that all currently existing schools of Buddhism had become overly esoteric and no longer thought the Buddha's lessons as he would have wished them. As such he created the "Buddh aur unaka dhamm" which was a recounting of the Buddha's teachings and life with the addition of commentaries added by Ambedkar. This was meant to remove some of the esotericism which had developed in the previously existing sects.;;;;;;;;;x

mattaism_DESC;A heresy spawned from just before the event from the theology of Father Matta El Meskeen. He came to blows with the Coptic papacy over the nature of original versus personal sin and the importance of personal faith in god over that of the collective faith in the church. He believed Original sin prior to Jesus was something that an individual could overcome through good deeds and that after the crucifixion one could overcome original sin by either accepting Jesus as their savior or through their own good deeds. As such Mattaists are extremely charitable to their impoverished citizens. He also believed in the total separation of the church and the state such that the church would not interfere with state policies. Overall the importance he placed on personal faith and his critiques of the Coptic church led to Mattaists believing post event that they no longer needed a papacy to govern them.;;;;;;;;;x

fraticelli_DESC;The Neo-Fraticelli, or 'New Little Brethren', is a Catholic heresy that was inspired by records of a medieval heresy of the same name. It is devoted to poverty and asceticism - especially for men of the cloth. Fraticelli heretics are violently opposed to Church wealth and displays of opulence among the populace. This is due to Mammon Prince of Greed being viewed as the demon King of the Old World, he grew so powerful as to overthrow Lucifer Prince of Pride himself. He brought about the fall of the Old World intentionally therefore the sin of greed is considered as fatal, if not more than, pride. They see the Old World as a society of Pharisees who, instead of helping those in need, separated from them because they bothered their hearts.;;;;;;;;;x

Within the Middle East, but outside of their community, the Mandaeans are more commonly known as the Subba or Sabians. The term Subba is derived from the Aramaic root related to baptism, the neo-Mandaic is Sabi. Occasionally, Mandaeans are called "Christians of Saint John".;;;;;;;;;x

They believe that if every tyrant is removed from the face of the Earth, eternal prosperity will come to it, and so they try to go on grand campaigns to rid the world of these scum. Neo-Huguenots are heavily inspired by the Monarchomach theorists of pre-event France and consider tyrannicide to be a necessity in the fight for equality before God. They see feudalism as a tool for self-serving monarchs to consolidate more power for their selfish interests, so instead they follow a theocratic government where only the most pious and altruistic get to rule. The Queen of the Thelemites is considered to be the embodiment of a tyrant and her followers demon worshippers, and Novelists are known to have first brought back feudal law after the event, and so both are the main targets of Neo-Huguenot incursions. Catholics and other Protestants are both viewed with heavy distrust, as they both adhere to feudal structures and are also blamed for the destruction of the original Huguenots, a bitterness that never faded.;;;;;;;;;x

neodonatists_DESC;Neo-Donatists believe that the Last Judgement has come and the people of the world have been found lapse and unworthy of ascension. This means that all people on earth are stained by their sins and have been abandoned by God. The theology of this heresy ponders the implications of the event that destroyed the world of men identifying It, as many Christians did, with the Last Judgement. But in particular, adherents of this branch of Orthodoxy asked themselves if the apocalypse came to the world, why haven't the dead been resurrected and the rightful called at the right of the Father. There are different interpretations of why this happened: some believe that during the Event the apocalypse happened in full, the dead were revived and the children of God judged. What remains of the world today is nothing but the tortures of hell. Others believe that the Event has only heralded the apocalypse and the only reason why the dead haven't been resurrected is that the earth was so full of sin that God rebuked it. Thus, the world now exists as a limbo between the Judgement of God and the damnation of Hell.;;;;;;;;;x

lakefolk_pagan_DESC;A post event religion from across the Atlantic and near the Great Lakes, the Four Guardians faith has a deep connection to the cycles of the world and its natural power. Principally, there are only five truly divine beings in its cosmology, the Five Thunderbirds. The four lesser birds rule over each of the four winds and the greater Thunderbird, their father, rules over all creation. The four seasons of the year are ruled by four demi-gods - Paul Bunyan the Sower of Spring, Minne the Mistress of the Great River, Jack O'Lantern the Headless Bringer of Fall, and Father Christmas, who both rules over winter and delivers the Child, which is a representation of the new year being born following the battle between King Boreas and Vulcanus Rex.;;;;;;;;;x

aurorean_reformed_DESC;The Aurorean faith is the disparate belief system of the coast and sea-dwelling Alaskans, spread widely across their homeland in the North Pacific, and varying wildly from city state to city state. The faith holds that there are three tiers of great spirits in their pantheon. The greater gods are aspects of Ellam Yua, the spirit of the universe, in the form of the Celestial Ram, the Earthly Ewe, and the Annointed Lamb, are beyond the mortal world of men and are the creators and orchestrators of the Earth, the sky, and all of life's symphonies. The lesser gods, such as the Raven and the Thunderbird, are those who live in the spirit world as mediators between the world of man and the world of gods, and control much of the earthly realm on the greater gods' behalf. Lastly are the various animistic spirits who inhabit the earth, sea, and sky, such as dwarfs and gnomes, and most importantly of all, the Aurorean Heavenly Host, a great army of spirits marching across the sky for which the religion is named. Aurorean shamans attempt to invoke the spirits for good luck, good weather, and bountiful seas, and the vast and elaborate creation stories of the frozen north are frequently retold at potlatches.;;;;;;;;;x

sedevacantist_DESC;The Gallicanist Papacy was formed in the year 2205, with the last Patriarch of Québec proclaiming himself Pope Bien-Aimé I. The Québécois Patriarchate was one of many positions in the newly-formed Council of Patriarchs, meant to hold Catholicism together in total absence of papal contact. Claiming to have received an apparition from the Blessed Virgin, the now-Pope declared the old Papacy forfeit, and forced a massive schism in the Catholic Church of Canada, with many bowing to his word as the new Vicar of Christ, and many more denouncing him as a fraud and a heretic. Ultimately, the Gallicanist Church held its own in the aftermath of ecclesiastical controversy, spawning a new line of American Popes. Whether or not this neo-Catholic Church will survive the eventual backlash of old Catholicism to come its way remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;x

constitutional_DESC;"One nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."\nSomething between a philosophy and a religion, the Constitutionalist faith is one that will bow to no gods, and no tyrants. Those who can be considered Constitutionalist faithful, for they are more zealous in their beliefs than most who are religious, do not bother themselves with prayers, nor churchgoing. The duty of every Constitutionalist is to uphold the values as dictated by the Constitution, which was put together thanks to the Common Sense of Man, as granted to him by Providence when he was first lifted to sapience by the invisible hand of freedom. Those who truly believe in the divine Americana consider the shining city upon a hill to be paradise on Earth, and every free man is entitled to see it prosper under Old Glory.\nThough the American Dream had been lost during the First Retreat and many of its lands have since fallen to ignorance and backward zealotry, the Constitutionalists believe that just as America rose all those centuries ago, thanks to the foundations laid by the Founding Fathers, it will rise again like a phoenix from the ashes thanks to those very principles - Pragmatism, Jingoism, Foundationalism, and Transcendentalism.\nBecause America is an exceptional country founded by exceptional men.;;;;;;;;;x

columbian_DESC;Consisting of what little is left of Catholicism in the lands of the old United States, the Columbian Catholic Church consists of the main Church, led by the Latin Patriarch, and the Mississippian rites, led by the Grandmaster of the Watchers in the Dark. Due to contact with Rome being all but impossible after the Event, the position of Archbishop of Washington was elevated to become the Latin Patriarch, encompassing all Catholics east of Appalachia, and representing them on the Council of Patriarchs. With the Watchers being organised in the 22nd century, they were included under the Latin Patriarchy's jurisdiction as well, but given special autonomy to operate under their own rites.\nSince then, however, the Church has hit a rough patch, with the Church's possessions in the Columbian capital being seized by the federal government, and the Patriarch being forced to retreat to Albany. With the encroaching Constitutionalists wishing to control the Church, the old Catholics of the east turning to heathenry, and the Church in Québec being usurped by a false Pope, only time will tell if the One True Church will survive to meet the Pope in Rome once again.;;;;;;;;;x

Formed from all the traditional Protestant denominations in many churches and conventions, it is decentralised and focused on personal salvation. Thanks to the efforts of the High Kings of the Two Carolinas, the Mainline churches favour a more theologically liberal approach, one that has brought them into conflict with the more radical elements of the faith, leading to many wars and skirmishes with the Evangelicals of the Deep South, both sides fighting in the name of the same God. Nonetheless, even after losing much of its follower base to cults of revelation and paganism, the Seven Sisters of American Protestantism will endure as they always have.;;;;;;;;;x

tridemism_DESC;Sanminzhuyi is a faith based around the teachings of the great Sapphire Didact found in the book "Principle of Minsheng". The Sapphire Didact rose to prominence in a great war the century before the event during this war 8 great armies of barbarians led by demonic lords arrayed themselves against the Middle Kingdom, slaughtering millions, forcing the Emperor of China to seek divine assistance from the Jade Emperor to fight off these hordes. The Jade Emperor granted his aid to the Middle Kingdom and raised 8 Great Generals to semi-divinity to fight back against the hordes. The Sapphire Didact proved himself to be the greatest of these generals and alongside the sly Ruby Chairman who saw himself raised to full divinity by the Jade Emperor as reward for saving China. However, the Jade Emperor himself had too shown his weakness by allowing these demons to grow so powerful to begin with, and through the wisdom of the Sapphire Didact he concluded that his continued reign would prove disastrous for his beloved China. As such with the assistance of the sly Ruby Chairman he overthrew the Jade Emperor and forced him into hiding for a time. However it would not be long until the Ruby Chairman showed his true colours and overthrew the Sapphire Didact through deceit and cunning, forcing him to retreat to Taiwan. From there he has gradually extended his influence back to the mainland and seeks to reclaim his beloved China for the betterment of all it's peoples and a return to the harmony of the universe.;;;;;;;;;x
maoist_DESC;Liehuo follows the teachings of the Heavenly Ruby Chairman, ruler of the Heavenly Mandate of all. Though once a man, the Chairman ascended to godhood to protect China from the Eight Armies of Evil and the Event to restore harmony to the world after the Jade Emperor was deposed. He fought alongside one of the Jade Emperor's most powerful warriors, The Sapphire Didact, against these eight armies of barbarians and demons. Following their victory these two turned on each other for the throne of heaven and the followers of the Sapphire Didact were banished to Taipei, he still insidiously plots from his island realm among his followers. The Chairman's teachings are left behind in the Red Book for them to follow, so that they might achieve righteousness and not fall to the lies of either the old Jade Emperor or the Deceiving Sapphire Didact. They strongly believe in the obligation to spread the Ruby Chairman's influence to the rest of the world especially the holdouts of the Jade Emperor and Sapphire Didact.;;;;;;;;;x
taoist;Daojiao;;;;;;;;;x
taoist_DESC;Daojiao is a polytheistic religion originating in China, by the 26th century it is isolated to solely southern China following the rise of Liehuo in the north. While traditionally regarded as founded by Laozi the Supreme Old Lord in the 4th century BC, some elements and practices can be traced to prehistoric folk religions across the Middle Kingdom. The followers revere Tao, the underlying natural order of the Universe  the active expression of Tao for an individual is Te, the inner virtue. Daojiao also value life over death, and believe it possible to achieve immortality, through various methods, including spiritual practices and alchemy. One of its most important dieties, the Jade Emperor, is believed to have been betrayed by two of his servants in the century prior to the event and remains in conflict with them to this day. These two servants were his two greatest generals in the fight against a horde of barbarians led by a series of Demon lords from beyond the middle kingdom, the barbarians and their demon lords proved too mighty for china to overcome without divine assistance. The Jade emperor granted it and lifted 8 generals to semi-divinity they protected china and their two greatest leaders, the Ruby Chairman and the Sapphire didact as they are now known, were raised even higher to the rank of full divinity. But they believed that the Jade Emperor had grown weak to allow these demons to grow so powerful and sought to overthrow him. The religions of Sanminzhuyi and Liehuo represent their followers, this series of events has upset the balance of the cosmos which cannot be restored unless both of these rebellious servants are brought to heel.;;;;;;;;;x

jacobinist_DESC;The followers of the Jacobinist faith believe that Robespierre, savior of humanity, came to the world to placate the eternal hunger of Madame Guillotine. After the death of her prophet, killed by the ignorance of traitors, Madame Guillotine was left unfed, and in the end it was humanity that paid the price in the form of the Event, when she took all the lives she was denied for too long. The Jacobinists have sworn that this will never again happen. Madame Guillotine shall never again be left without food, no matter the cost. It is a sacrifice of a few for the sake of the many.;;;;;;;;;x

jugoslavist_DESC;The youngest of all Syncretic churches, the Jugoslavist faith was born when the Car of Jugoslavia, hard pressed in keeping his diverse Empire united, made a desperate attempt, calling a great Council of all holy men in his lands, fusing all faiths in his domains in a single religion and forcing them all to accept it or lose their heads. Taking from both the beliefs of Orthodox and Catholics, and additionally from the teachings of the Sunni Prophet, Jugoslavism is still weak, not truly spread outside of the capitals of the nation, where the Kings have more or less begrudgingly embraced the edict of the Emperor. The only one that can strengthen it is the Car of all Jugoslavia.;;;;;;;;;x

karmapa_DESC;The Karmapa or 'Red Hat' school of Buddhism was once simply another form of Tibetan Buddhism, considered equally valid alongside the others. However, when the Chinese captured the Panchem Lama, they produced a new Panchem Lama, a Han Chinese man whom they claimed to be the true Lama (called 'the Red Lama' by Tibetans). Most Tibetans rejected this 'new Lama', but some accepted him. This led to a rift in the community, as it was no longer clear who the real Panchem Lama was, thus the traditional means of selecting the Dalai Lama could no longer be used. Those who followed the Red Llama came to be confused with the historical 'Red Hats' school, and now even the knowledge that there used to be another group called by this name has been forgotten.;;;;;;;;;x
katerinist;Katerinist;;;;;;;;;x
katerinist_DESC;Katerinist belief states that the Great Holy Spirit and Mother Russia are two equal aspects of the divine energy of the universe, one being masculine and the other feminine. They believe that while the Spirit created the world, Mother Russia created man, and in Her own image gave women the divine power of birth and motherly love. As such, they hold that, just as man is born from a woman, so too were great Russia, its golden age and its glory born from Catherine the Great, the Divine Mother. Katerinists claim that, while every Tsar is blessed by the Spirit, only the Tsarina-Mother was truly divine, and perfect evidence that women are the natural leaders of mankind. Contemporary Tsarists, however, do not believe that Mother Russia is a literal deity, believing the name to merely be a metaphor for the Great Holy Spirit.;;;;;;;;;x

khanist_DESC;A blend of Mongol nationalism and Tengri paganism, Khanism is the belief in the divinity of the great legendary hero Temujin, who in times past conquered the world and gained the title of 'Genghis Khan', or 'Universal Ruler'. Khanists believe that, at the height of his power, Temujin was betrayed by his friend, Han, and cast into the jaws of The Red Menace. Now, they ride ever onward over the plains, hoping to find the Red Menace's cave and free Temujin from his imprisonment.;;;;;;;;;x

lutheran_DESC;Laestadianism is a pietistic movement within Lutheranism founded by pre-Event preacher Lars Levi Laestadius. Pietism places especial focus on individual piety and virtue, with Laestadianism advocating for a sinless, spiritual life, free from worldly vices and material greed. Simplicity and worldlessness are important in the every day life of Laestadians, with vanity being frowned upon, as a lavish lifestyle is considered sinful, as well as drinking, dancing, and bodily modifications. If knowingly sinned, a faithful believer should confess to another believer, so that his sins may be forgiven in Jesus' name and blood. In North America, Laestadianism managed to prevail as the largest Protestant sect in the northwest, thanks to its hard emphasis on tradition, though it is to be seen if it will survive, being surrounded by heathens on all sides.;;;;;;;;;x
vagarna;Vaesenite;;;;;;;;;x
vagarna_DESC;The Church of Enchanted Beings, named after the concept of "väsen", claims to be the successors of millennia old traditions of the European North. Though functionally Christian, centuries of distortion have rendered them a completely separate religion. Emphasis on oral traditions and folk stories have pushed its Biblical aspects into less and less importance, while belief in the supernatural and the hidden has become key parts of everyday life. The unifying part of this folklore is belief in hidden magical creatures, such as gnomes, trolls, and elemental spirits. Protector spirits and patron deities are also frequent and vary from region to region, of note is the presence of several severely distorted Aesir amongst the regional mythologies.;;;;;;;;;x

They adhere strongly to the story of Satanael, an angel who fell in defiance of the corrupt whims of Yaldabaoth, a demonic power who fooled humanity into thinking it was God. Satanael allied itself with the hero Luther who sought out warriors and true believers to topple the pope and his false god. In honour of this story they have moved ever further south, where they are now in majority, ready to pounce on the papist realms before them.;;;;;;;;;x

easternprotestant_DESC;With obscure origins dating back to antediluvian missionaries from Western Europe, Eastern Protestantism is an amalgamation of various Protestant sects with Orthodoxy. Its congregation exists as a loose union of churches formed from the remnants of these ancient missionary activities. Despite the influences, Eastern Protestantism still maintains Orthodox traditions since its inception, and are preformed in the Byzantine Rite. Its adherents also share many commonalities Syriac and Chaldean Churches, which include religious calendars, festivals, and reverence of saints. At the same time, Eastern Protestants also revere Western Protestant figures like Lucas Cranach the Elder, Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Roger Williams.;;;;;;;;;x

The Ma'aravim have long since integrated into the American system and thus are far removed from the affairs of Old World Judaism.

While they agree about core principles of Hasidic Judaism, many sects have arose following the teachings of several important Rebbes.;;;;;;;;;x
malikite_DESC;The Sharifi school of thought is a sect of Islam from the Maghreb which has developed some heterodox beliefs, especially regarding who can be Caliph. In the chaos of the Post-Event world, many Muslims yearn for a Caliph to unite and defend the Ummah, but nobody has been strong enough and legitimate enough to do so in several hundred years. The Sharifi of Morocco, seeing the power of the Alaouite dynasty, came to believe that an Alaouite could become Caliph, even if he were not of the Quraysh tribe. This position has brought them into conflict with other Muslims, creating a rift in African Islam.;;;;;;;;;x

Mesopotamianism is internally considered an Islamic faith, but are denounced by the wider Islamic world as mushrikun - polytheists, for their reverence of ancestral Mesopotamian gods. Namely, the Mesopotamians revere figures such as Ishtar and Ea, whom they consider to be karubiyin loyal to Allah. They believe that these archangels, now carved into millennia old stones, guided old Mesopotamians before Islam. Under their guidance, the ancient Mesopotamians founded the Empire of Mesopotamia, which ruled the orient for millennia as the one true domain of Allah, until they were shattered by Iblis as revenge for being cast from heaven. The Mesopotamians now believe it is their destiny to restore the ancient empire as the one true ummah and usher in a new golden age.;;;;;;;;;x

With the chaos of the Event cutting India off from most outside communication, the various Nasrani Churches (both those in communion with the Pope and those in communion with the Eastern Church) united together for the sake of convenience. The example of several holy men has caused the Nasranis to grow in popularity over the last few decades, to the point where they are a majority in Kerala, in the southwestern coast of India, though they are still a minority overall.;;;;;;;;;x

Among those men, the greatest in all the fields of Knowledge were Nobel and his laureates, whose discoveries led humanity forward. However, the Merchant of Death always whispers in the hears of those willing to listen, and so it was that the glory of humanity also created great destruction, until the world was returned to the darkness of ignorance. The Nobelians struggle to return humanity to its former glory, believing they can recreate the greatness of the Old World.;;;;;;;;;x

nousthreskeia_DESC;Originating in the distant and unknowable snowlands east of Russia, Razumism is a religion focused on the belief in a phenomenon known as "Mirovoy Razum" by which all human consciousness is thought to be linked. Razumists believe that this world mind is capable of altering human consciousness and the world. This is the origin of spirits with some being the human perspective of concepts and others being the impact humans have left on the collective mind after their death, enabling them to somewhat live on post death. They believe that the Event was caused by the uncontrolled collective mind growing restless and harming humanity. They believe that if humanity is to return to a pre-event stage of advancement it must first mature collectively.;;;;;;;;;x

The religion has been reformed and codified, with a unified set of beliefs and rituals.;;;;;;;;;x

baltic_pagan_DESC;Romuva is polytheistic, with a pantheon of gods led by Dievs, god of the sky. Other main gods include Perkunas, god of thunder and lightning, very similar to the ancient Scandinavian god Thor and the Slavic Perun. Other important deities include Saule, goddess of the sun and fertility, Daugava and Meness. After the Apocalypse this ancient religion underwent a renaissance in its number of followers until the majority of the Lithuania, Latvia and Western Belarus were followers of the faith. The Catholics of Nearby Poland could not stand for the heathenry which their once Lithuanian brothers had adopted and they led the charge in a crusade to wipe out the faith in Lithuania once more. By 2555 the religion exists only in a few isolated pockets, largely in secret given the Catholic faith which has reclaimed Lithuania.;;;;;;;;;x

tengri_pagan_DESC;The almighty frontier of old America is a harsh, unforgiving place. Endless swathes of prairie gave birth to a deeply spiritual people that inhabit it. The core of Great Plains spirituality is based on worship of the Sky Father - the king of the universe and father of all. The Sky Father is not worshipped like God is in Christian stories, rather he is a concept - the ultimate reality of the universe. The Sky Father is not a god, he is the universe itself, all energy that dwells in it, and all energy that dwells outside of it. Simply, the Sky Father is the reality from which all men, all stars, and all gods are born from - an endless void of energy that all came from and all will one day return to.\nWorshippers of the Sky Father believe that when a living being dies, its soul returns to the Sky Father by ascending into Heaven. There is no concept of Hell, only Heaven and the path required to get to it. Thus, elaborate funerals are given to the dead, so that their soul may reach Heaven and not get trapped in the great Frontier - the spiritual inbetween of Heaven and Earth.\nOther than the Sky Father himself, many gods are worshipped by the faithful of the Plains, the most important of which being the Earth Mother, who is the Sky Father's wife and who gave birth to the Sun and the Moon. The Sun is the protector of mankind, who will in the great future descend to Earth as a great messiah to bring all the faithful into Heaven, and the Moon is the deceitful, proud counterpart to the Sun, whose existence keeps the universe in balance.\nNow, the faithful of the Sky Father come in many names, with their god having many interpretations, and many different rituals, but the core is not lost. Thus, the cowboys of the Plains roam the endless prairie in search of truth, hoping to better understand their god, the universe, some day.;;;;;;;;;x

zenith_DESC;The Zenith are the most ardent worshippers of the transcendental Sky Father, whom they consider the ultimate reality of the universe. As many would agree with them, however, he is not one to speak to his followers, for the Sky Father is a deity beyond human comprehension. Though he exists on a spiritual plane that is unreachable by people, the mortal world as we know is still the great sum of his creation, and everything in it is a shard of the reality of the Sky Father.\nThere is one spirit that the Zenith consider above mere creation, the love and warmth of the Sky Father enshrined, and it is the Eye of the Father itself - Sol. Without the Sun, there would be no light, no life, and no warmth. The opposite of the Sun's warmth - the Sky Father's other eye - is that of the Moon, which embodies the darkness and death that prevail in the Sun's absence. The Moon is worshipped still, however, as one half of the Father's will manifested - the male reality of the universe being that of the Sun, and the female that of the Moon.\nOther than the great eyes in the sky, many spirits are worshipped by the Zenith, as fragments of the Father's divine will. Examples include Pike, the eternal watcher of the great Rockies, and Luis and Clark, great spirits who drag the Sun behind them, riding in a grand ironhorse. The Sun is frequently invoked in lavish rituals meant to bring good health and wealth to the people. The Moon is invoked as well, though not as often, in great funerary proceedings, or for the banishment of evil spirits.\nThe temples of the Zenith are directly controlled by the Radiant Sun King, an earthly avatar of Sol, and the human conduit of the Sky Father's will. The glory of the Sun and his King are celebrated during the Summer Solstice, an event called the Zenith, the religion's namesake. The Winter Solstice holds a similar festival in the name of the Moon, meant to send the souls of those who died back to the Sky Father.;;;;;;;;;x

rangerite_DESC;Rangerites believe that as God reigned in Heaven, Texas reigned in America, manifesting itself as the holy lands projected and honored by the strongest among the faithful. America protected its brood of 50 star-spangled inheritors to its throne by its very nature as the enforcer of law and bringer of prosperity throughout the world.\nHowever, as time passed, America grew swollen and bloodthirsty, the very foundations of its existence eroding due to the weakness of those who were incapable of upholding the divine mandates they inherited from their forefathers, and the unwillingness to correct the mistakes enacted by those who cared not for the sacred or the profane. Eventually, America, once great, died: the subsequent chaos which resulted in her death hardened the hearts of those known now as the Rangerites, who defend the seat of power of Texas and allow her and her alone to survive.\nThe Rangerites, prideful militants to the last, have no love for those who continue to cling to the illusion that America still exists, and views them as lowly worshipers of a divine corpse. Those who continue to defend Texas additionally adhere to those ancient spirits which were neglected in the ancient days, but, with the death of America, now thrive: the Rangerites understand that to honor and worship Texas in the proper way is to honor those spirits of the land which their forefathers neglected, and view themselves as the true inheritors of all the world. Indeed, there is only one state under God, one and indivisible, that will last forever and ever: those who defend it are the last true men in all the world.;;;;;;;;;x

custodite_DESC;The Adaptive Emergency Chain of Command was founded after the Event by the quickly shrinking United States Armed Forces as a strict set of protocols and guidelines for its troopers, in order to keep the Armed Forces alive under any means necessary. They were, however, unsuccessful, losing all control of America for many years to come. However, the descendants of these brave men and women take great pride in their traditions, and are willing to go to great lengths to maintain their faith in the United States of America. Though the different branches of the AECC occasionally have difficulties in seeing eye to eye, they hold great respect for each other in their ageless commitment of upholding the values of Old Glory. The Custodians of America, as they call themselves, no longer stand unified, and many great Generals now seek to unite the bickering Custodites, hoping to reinstate the Northern Command, which would make them the first Commander-in-Chief in hundreds of years. Until then, the Generals swear by their sacred eternal oaths to uphold the Three's Last Orders and keep Lady's Columbia destiny manifested.;;;;;;;;;x

millenarian_DESC;The stranded Christians of the northern Great Plains have taken a unique outlook to all the burning questions asked by the trauma of the Event. Giving rise to a new movement of Millenarianism, they believe that the return of Jesus Christ is imminent - and he will rise from nothing to become the prophesied lord of a Heavenly Host. When all the world is under his divine rule, a thousand year utopia will be established, and all the spirits of ages past will be liberated and will return with the faithful to God the Father, where they will be reunited with his heavenly energy. Until then, the Millenarians live simple, humble lives, in familial religious communes, guided by local priests. They wait and watch carefully for the return of their prophesied Saviour, and may God help those who stand against him during the Days of Judgment.;;;;;;;;;x
exovedate;Exovedate;;;;;;;;;;;x
exovedate_DESC;The Exovedes are followers of Louis David Riel, the Prophet of the New World. They claim that long before the Event, Riel was given a vision by God, who instructed him to become the chosen leader of the Métis of Canada, and lead his flock like Moses to a new Israel, their very own promised land. During his time on Earth, Riel gathered the disparate native and Métis masses and professed the new true faith to them. The Exovedate Church reintroduced polygamy, allowed the marriage of priests, reinstituted Mosaic Law, and encouraged circumcision and Saturday Sabbath, though the true faith was all but lost after Riel's execution by the forces of L'Awnfayr. Now, many centuries after the old revolt, the Exovedes gather in the Great Plains, reviving the holy words of their Prophet. They believe that the timeline of the world is split into two halves, each lasting 2333 years. The first 2333 years started in 457 BC, with the mission of Ezra, and ended in 1876, with the birth of Riel. They hold that the apostolic succession of St. Peter was lost with the death of Riel, and it became the duty of the Exovedate Church afterwards to transfer the true Vicariate of Christ to Montréal starting in the year 2333, the Old World Papacy being forfeit, which will begin the age of Métis fulfilment as the chosen tribe of Israel, lasting 1876 more years until the year 4209, which marks the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.;;;;;;;;;;;x

lone_star_DESC;One God, one America, one Texas, three revolutions. These are the words that encapsulate the Lone Star. All followers of the Lone Star believe in a trinitarian conception of one God that includes three aspects: America, Jesus, and Texas. Each of these aspects of the trinity once initiated a great revolution that changed the world, in which the heavens and the Earth briefly merged and chosen men acted as empowered agents of the trinity, invincible and glorious, the true favored sons of God. It is known among these men that while all may become servants of God, only some may become American and only a favoured few within old America had the capacity to become Texan: it is said that while all God-fearing men viewed America with awe, Americans looked towards Texas with similar wonder and reverence. The grit, tenancy, and wealth of those who had total mastery of the land and the skies, and who extract liquid gold from the stones itself were the lords of the world.\nWhile all Lone Star believers pray to God and America in equal measure, it is the recreation of the Lone Star State of being, where all worthy men and women may live within a worldly paradise built by the strong men and women who revolutionised the world thrice over that all desire in their heart of hearts.\nHowever, to unify the strongest and proudest men in all the world, those who worship the old histories and the very lands their herds trot upon and the skies their hawks soar over, is a daunting task: indeed, what generation will produce the finest son of Texas, who can reunite the old treasure-cities and fly the six flags?;;;;;;;;;x

oldbeliever_DESC;The Old Believers trace their founding to an event called the Raskol, long before the Deluge. They maintain that the corrupt Patriach Nikon caused the Raskol by calling for mass reform of the Church, a deed that only could have been commanded by Satan himself. As a result of Nikon's perversions, the Russian Orthodox Church was split into two - the Old Believer churches of the faithful, and the degenerate main Church that eventually devolved into Tsarism, a stain in the eyes of the Lord. The first Old Believers escaped into the remote and inhospitable wilderness of Russia, and when the Earth was destroyed by God, they persisted and reorganised. Now they are formally united in one true Russian Orthodox Church led by the First Hierarch, an elevated priest with limited authority so as to never again cause another Raskol.;;;;;;;;;x

sevillian_DESC;In the final days before the event, the Archangel Raphael sent a vision to a man now known as a great Saint to the Sevillians. It showed him that Rome had become corrupt once more and that the Vicar of Christ should no longer be seated in that wretched city, instead demanding it should be seated in the righteous city of Seville, and if this did not occur a great calamity would befall the world. He attempted to warn the church of the vision, who refused to place their faith in him. In preparation for the oncoming calamity he sought to gather as many followers as possible and establish a new church in the world which would come after, becoming the first Sevillian Pope. When he revealed to the people of Spain that it was the Papacy who had led them to the apocalypse, many of the most fundamentalist Catholics who in the years before the event had grown tired with the growing progressivism of the church flocked to this new church's banners after the event, believing it to better represent the church of old. With all of Spain now following the Sevillian Pope, the faith can now hope to crush the misguided Catholics and their Pope in Rome, and return the world under the shield of the one true church.;;;;;;;;;x

petrist_DESC;Unlike mainstream Tsarism, Petrism states that there are no more Tsars to be blessed in this world. Petrists claim that the unbroken line of Tsars ended with the death of the almighty Peter the Great, Tsar of Man. Petrists adamantly believe that all Tsars after Peter were nothing but imposters, with their degeneracy in life a clear display of falsehood. Tsar Nicholas was a weak and incompetent man, deceived by the demon Rasputin and ultimately killed and consumed by the wicked Lord Stalin, the personification of all evil. The death of Tsar Peter was the death of Mother Russia, with the events that followed culminating in the death of the world itself. Thus, the most important belief of the Petrists is that the apotheosis of Tsar Peter was the last, and will be the last once Peter returns to Earth in flesh to gather the faithful and bring forth a new Great Russia.;;;;;;;;;x

Germania, guided by a Kanzler, was one of these civilisations, showing her many faces through the ages, being there to calm her people, giving them freedom like no other, and providing for their needs. But the Devil decieved Germania, giving her delusions of grandeur and a right to rule over the world, and made her unleash her wrath on earth, causing the Event. For this Heimwehist believe they must pay penance for God, to feel the pain the peoples of old felt, preach for peace among everyone, and rid themselves of sin, for one must be a Kanzler of themselves before they can be a Kanzler of Germania.;;;;;;;;;x

The Mikraists instead believe that the primacy of the older generations of Rabbis cannot be challenged by the current generation of thinkers and thus no contradictions are allowed to arise. The Mikraists seek to find the legendary Mashiach ben Yosef, who they believe is hidden among pious Jews, awaiting to be found and lead the Jewish people to the Messianic Age by cleansing the Land of Israel from evil forces and rebuild a proper Third Temple.;;;;;;;;;x

The Guru Granth Sahib speaks of one society unified under One God, where all men are free and love each other regardless of their beliefs. Until then, however, the Sikhs do their best to live by their faith with the utmost discipline. The Guru Granth Sahib speaks of the Five Ks that a Sikh must always carry, and the Four Prohibitions that a Sikh must always avoid, and all Sikh societies must follow the Three Pillars as laid down by Guru Nanak. Even the most zealous of heathens hold respect for the Sikh, their temples always being open regardless of faith, and their charities rivalling even the richest kingdoms in their reach.;;;;;;;;;x

After the defeat of the Tsar at the hands of the revolution, Lenin sought to return his body and divine essence to the Great Holy Spirit only for him to be struck down by Stalin and Trotsky, who wished to steal the Tsar's power for themselves. Stalin kept Trotsky at bay long enough to steal the Tsar's power all for himself, ascending to godhood. The Holy Spirit was enraged at this turn of events and told Stalin that one day, Lenin would reincarnate among the Russian people to destroy him and his followers. Only then under the rule of the Leninov would Russia become a land of peace and prosperity once again.;;;;;;;;;x

stalinist_DESC;The Stalinist faith reveres Lord Stalin as the only Tsar worthy of worship as he earned his divinity through his own deeds. Mainstream Zarism came to regard Stalin-worship as heretical early on due to legends that portray Tsar Stalin as having usurped his power from Nicholas the Martyr by killing him with the help of Lenin and Trotsky and consuming his essence, as such the Stalinists were driven away by long years of persecution. Stalinists believe that only through tireless devotion and loyalty can they help Lord Stalin defend the Motherland from its many enemies including the Great Holy Spirit who wishes to bring ruin to all Stalinist realms for Lord Stalin's usurpation. They also believe that similar to their lord they may become divine like a Tsar by consuming the essence of one. Stalin is believed to have been betrayed following his ascension by one of his followers, this traitor attempted to consume Stalin as Stalin had consumed Nicholas. He survived this assault on his being, but was so distraught by it that he saw traitors everywhere and used his divine powers to purge them. It is still debated to this day who this traitor was exactly.;;;;;;;;;x

Through proselytising to already existing but devastated Muslim communities, the Inayati Order found a base of support amongst them, as well as finding its place as one of the religions of the highways, with its universalist message accessible to anyone, much to the chagrin of the more fundamentalist elements of their communities.;;;;;;;;;x

Thus, the Queen was granted eternal dominion over the summer, and the knight became the King of Winter. Their subjects on earth were free to revel under their protection, enjoying celebrations of morris dancing, maypoles, the burning of wicker men, and vast amounts of cider.

barelvi_DESC;The Barelvi strand of Sunni Islam has been the largest Muslim force in southern Asia for centuries, even before the Old World was struck down. A Sufi revivalist movement, the Barelvi traditionally believe in the light of Muhammad, the belief that the Prophet was one of Allah's first creations, and now exists as light to spread God's knowledge and intercede on the behalf of Muslims. Barelvi rituals include the chanting of dhikr, and the veneration of Muslim saints. Sufi Tariqahs such as the Qadiri, Chishti and Naqshbandi orders are also very popular. With the Muslims of Bangladesh largely turning to syncretism, the Barelvi movement has effectively been reduced to the lands traditionally considered to be Pakistan.;;;;;;;;;x

Despite that, Deobandism is not fundamentally opposed to sufism, believing that it is a fundamental part of Islam and that more esoteric practices like dhikr and Mawlid should be avoided. The Deobandi movement has been greatly influenced by the Wahhabist and Salafist movements to the point where Deobandist rulers traditionally use a form of stratocracy - the ghazwa.;;;;;;;;;x

theosophy_DESC;Theosophists are the followers of the Ascended Masters, beings that shepherd the spiritual and intellectual development of humanity. Theosophy was merely one of many foreign esoteric religions to gain a foothold in the British Isles following the Event and the subsequent collapse of the Church. Nonetheless, it was eventually largely stomped out by Thelemites and their Queen. According to Theosophist teachings, it was when the world closed their hearts to the lessons of the Ascended Masters that mankind grew distant from Nature and Truth relying more and more upon false religions before the Old World collapsed under the burden of ignorance and desire that it carried upon its back. Numerous legends hold that a Lord Maitreya will emerge to transfer knowledge about the true constitution and workings of Existence to humankind. Theosophists de-emphasise the importance of organized religious scripture, ritual, and hierarchy as a source of direct enlightenment, viewing them simply as roads for every individual to access the source of Truth. Additionally, Theosophy in the British Isles holds large amounts of influence from the Thelema faith, viewing the Queen as an ascended master in her own right.;;;;;;;;;x

theo_saint_germain_desc;This character is channeling Saint Germain, the chohan of the seventh ray, the Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, portrayed as a diplomat, the embodiment of dignity and statesmanship. Saint Germain is considered responsible for the founding of many civilisations and movements throughout history, including his incarnations as the god-king of the Golden Empire in the Sahara desert, the High Priest of Atlantis, the prophet Samuel, Saint Joseph, the explorer Columbus, and the philosopher Bacon. Following the Event with the heralding of the Aquarian Age his role as the Lord of Civilisation meant he became the main divine force alongside Sanat Kumara responsible for the rebuilding of civilisation and the retrieval of the God flame back into humanity's grasp.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_sanat_kunara_desc;This character is channeling Sanat Kumara, a powerful cosmic being, the Guru of Christ, hierarch of Venus and one of the seven holy Kumaras, said to be the former Lord of the World and the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, the fraternity of Ascended Masters across the world. Theosophists believe that following the Event he stepped down as the Lord with Saint Germain, the Lord of Civilisation taking his place, tasked with bringing the God flame back to humanity, and instead is dedicated to setting his believers on the path of the ruby ray from his domain in the mythical city of Shamballa.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_lady_master_venus_desc;This character is channeling Lady Master Venus, said to be the Divine Complement and Twin Flame to Sanat Kumara. Mankind is said to be her evolution, and she herself came to Earth following the Event to bring the holy flames of civilisation back to humanity. Some Theosophists also consider her to be a goddess of love.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_jesus_desc;This character is channeling Jesus Christ, the avatar of the Age of Pisces, the Messiah and the incarnation of the Word. During the Piscean age, he revealed the Christ Self to humanity to show the works of the God presence to each human soul. Theosophists believe that following his resurrection, Jesus travelled to Kashmir, where he ascended to the theric city of Shamballa. Following the Event, the Christ consciousness had been lost to many, leading to people turning away from his teachings en masse. Veneration of Jesus is seen with suspicion by the Thelemites, who consider him to be nothing more than an arrogant mystic.;;;;;;;;;x
theo_the_queen_desc;This character is channeling Our Lady of the Stars, the highest Thelemite deity, considered a Master of Ancient Wisdom in Theosophist belief. Following the Event, the Queen ascended to become a Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, called the Aeon of Ma'at in Thelema, ruling the cosmos while Saint Germain rules the earthly domain. While Thelema belief states that the Queen is an unknowable supreme being, Theosophists believe they can channel her and even contact her telepathically.;;;;;;;;;x

thelemic;Old Thelema;;;;;;;;;x
thelemic_DESC;The Old Thelema faith was mostly abandoned centuries ago by most inhabitants of the British Empire in favour of the current Thelema faith. Old Thelemites claim to be practising their faith as originally dictated by the prophet Crowley. They reject the position of the Lord Protectors as regents of the Queen, considering mainstream Thelemite beliefs to be a perversion of the goddess Nuit. Old Thelemites do not believe Nuit is to return to Earth to rule Britannia, and instead consider the British Empire to be a theologically oppressive state, hellbent on spreading their faith and state to all corners of the Earth, making them no different than the Church. This stance was cause for a massive civil war in Britain in the 23rd century, which led to their marginalisation from society. As such, Old Thelemites only persist in the fringes of Britain, and instead focus their practice on the personal will of the individual, acting to discover their True Will.;;;;;;;;;x
thelemic_reformed;Thelema;Thelema;Thelema;;Thelema;;;;;;;;;x
thelemic_reformed_DESC;The Thelema faith was founded by the great prophet Aleister Crowley long before the Event. With the creation of the new religion, Crowley heralded the new Aeon of Horus, and declared the main principle of Thelema: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law." The Thelemite faith is centered around a pantheon of deities, the main of which is the all-knowing and omnipresent Queen of the Heavens. The Queen rules over the cosmos and is the source of all energy and matter in our world. The central scripture became The Book of the Law, a holy text Crowley claimed to be revealed to him by Aiwass, an entity he considered his guardian angel and which modern Thelemites consider to be a manifestation of the Queen. Before the Event, the Thelemite faithful were ruthlessly pursued by the followers of Jesus on accusations of devil worship, being thrown into obscurity. After the deluge, however, Thelema experienced a massive resurgence in Britain, with the Queen declaring the first Lord Protectors of Britannia to rule the material world in her stead, thereby declaring a new aeon - the Aeon of Ma'at, securing Britannia's eternal dominion over the waves.;;;;;;;;;x

congregationist_DESC;Being the largest remaining Jewish community in Europe and the de-facto leaders of the continent's Jewry has made the United Synagogue of Britain one of the most influential institutions in Old World Judaism. Just like Britain of old, the Empire of Britannia has decided to continue recognizing the United Synagogue as an authority in Judaism and has promoted it as an umbrella organization for the myriad Jewish sects dotting Britain. Since then, the United Synagogue has integrated Sephardic congregations and has promoted a more secular lifestyle while keeping with orthodox Jewish traditions. The farthest sects falling under this umbrella are to be found in Russia.;;;;;;;;;x

federationist_DESC;Appealing to the Yiddish speaking masses in the lower classes of British society during the last centuries before the Event, the Federation of Synagogues is a rival institution to the United Synagogue.

The farthest sects falling under this umbrella are to be found in Russia.;;;;;;;;;x

mahayana;Mahayana;;;;;;;;;x
mahayana_DESC;Traditionally the largest and most popular vehicle of Buddhism in the Old World, Mahayana finds itself a small minority in the diverse lands of the Americas. Mahayana focuses on the importance of the Bodhisattvas, those who compassionate and kind enough to wish for little more than to attain Buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings. The Mahayana path is one that encourages all people to tread the path of the Bodhisattva as the ultimate ideal in Buddhism, greater than seeking Buddhahood for its own sake, as the only thing greater than being release from suffering yourself is helping those around you to do the same.\nMore esoteric than some other Buddhist yanas, the Mahayana have an elaborate cosmology of many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas existing in many different planes and worlds. The Buddha Shakyamuni remains on Earth out of compassion for the common creature, helping guide Bodhisattvas to enlightenment and guiding everyone to a life without suffering in the celestial Pure Lands of the many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of this world.;;;;;;;;;x

titoist_DESC;An obscure sect of Stalinism, Titoism holds that the follower who betrayed lord Stalin was the legendary ruler of Yugoslavia Tito. They believe that Tito betrayed Stalin in order to take the power he had stolen and utilise it to free his homeland from the rule of a despotic and malevolent Car. Titoists believe that Stalin did not survive the attempt on his life made by Tito and that Tito went on to free his homeland from the Tyranny of its old Car whom the great Holy spirit refused to strike down itself. Soon after he freed his people the Great holy spirit did battle with him in a great war for heaven, this was for having assisted in the murder of one of its appointed rulers and directly murdering another. This great heavenly war was the event and since that time Tito has been imprisoned in hell by the great holy spirit as he cannot be entirely destroyed given that he contains a fraction of the spirits own power. Only through devotion and loyalty from his small sect can Tito be freed and rule on earth once again.;;;;;;;;;x

trotskyite_DESC;A small offshoot of mainstream Stalinism, Trotskyists believe that Lord Stalin was in fact a traitor to Russia, and that Trotsky, an obscure figure in the Stalinist faith was his betrayer. He is believed to have betrayed Stalin because Stalin was abusing his divine powers, bringing ruin to Russia. Trotsky tried to reason with Stalin, that his power should be turned outward to the other rulers appointed by the Holy Spirit and that they should be overthrown. Stalin would not listen and it is additionally believed by the faith that Stalin was not originally meant to be the consumer of Nicholas when their group plotted his downfall. So Trotsky and others plotted the downfall of what they saw as another weak Tsar. Trotsky managed to consume part of Stalin in his attack, reducing Stalin's power significantly and conversely increasing the power of Trotsky. The two continued to battle continuously despite the damage done to the world, the peak of this being the event itself, yet until all Tsarists and Stalinists are destroyed and only Trotskyists remain, there can be no peace.;;;;;;;;;x

transatlantic_DESC;For years among merchants and sailors of different cultures and languages stories have been told about the distant lands of Mexico far beyond the Atlantic Ocean, where there is a religious leader protected by the archangel Raphael himself who rules the majority of Catholics from a city located on an island within a great lake. These stories have caused a fraction of Sevillians to come to the conclusion that this man is the true Pope and  that the Holy See was relocated again following the Event, such a revelation means that each and every one of the Christian Churches of the Old World is a vile heresy! As such, the Transatlantics declared themselves representatives of the Pope in Mexico and his council of cardinals, and decided to take it upon themselves to spread the word of the One True Pope.;;;;;;;;;x

cadaverist_DESC;Cadaverists are a small heretic sect that believe that one of the last Antediluvian Popes is not in fact dead, but can still miraculously speak to members of the higher Cadaverist clergy. It is said that the angel Gabriel came to him during the event and froze his mind within his body to preserve it, as a way to protect him from the calamity. They believe he will some day be restored to his pre-event form once the Cadaverist faithful make up all of the Christian faithful. It is unknown how they came to that conclusion, or how they obtained a corpse in full Papal Regalia. Unsurprisingly enough, the mainstream Catholic Church is not happy about the fact they keep said corpse atop a golden recreation of the Holy See and insisting that it can communicate. Cadaverists meanwhile consider all post-event Church popes to be antipopes, and all other Christians vile heretics who abandoned the Pope, who obviously was blessed by God himself with immortality.;;;;;;;;;x

Moving in step with smaller movements in Najd, Africa, Northern India, and more, just before the event it became a unified movement until the moniker of Salafiya. The name comes from the salaf, the first three generations of Muslims, which is believed to be the unadulterated and pure form of Islam. The Salafis believe that Sunnis should rely on the Quran and the Sunnah alone, while also rejecting any other branch or school of Islam as heretics or even non-Muslims.;;;;;;;;;x

zarist_DESC;Claiming to originate long before the Event, Tsarism is a religion that holds the world was created by a powerful god, the Great Holy Spirit. Though he created the first man, his children were deceived by demons and imposters, and abandoned him. Thus, the Lord bestows his grace and favour to a single temporal ruler, a prophet in flesh - a Tsar. Tsarists hold that the Tsar is blessed by the Lord with heavenly powers, commands the full obedience of his people and, after death, is taken to Heaven to be deified, where they continue to watch over the mortal world from beyond. Tsarists express their piety by praying to the Tsars of yore and going on pilgrimages to their burial sites, while the closest servants of the main Tsars are worshipped as saints, being personally guided by the blessed. Though Tsars are imbued with the Holy Spirit, they are not infallible, and there isn't a more telling example than the story of Lord Stalin, a Tsar who earned his powers by consuming the heart and blood of another, Tsar Nicholas the Martyr, for which he was banished from Heaven.;;;;;;;;;x

Jainism used to be a widespread religion in India but dwindled greatly in the centuries before the Event, decreasing to a very small minority. That changed in the post-Event world, where a new order of monks, called the Neeraji, vigorously proselytise for the faith, resulting in a great resurgence of Jainism throughout India.;;;;;;;;;x

This new form of Hellenism believes that the event was caused by Alexander the Great being reborn as Anaxorgos and overthrowing his father, Zeus. He is the twin brother of Athena, following his rebirth from Zeus' body he convinced many of his younger relatives to rise against Zeus and overthrow him. Ares and Athena were quick to join Anaxorgos, having given him great favour in life as preparation for this battle. When Poseidon took to his brother's defence it was his son Triton, with the aid of his ship and trusty Nereid attendant Averof, who entered battle against the ancient god of the sea and imprisoned him. Persephone convinced Hades to not partake in this familial battle and so he was spared by Anaxorgos due to the aid rendered by Persephone and her Brother Philomelus. It was this great battle between the younger Olympians and those of the older generation which was the event, and said event is evidence of his cousins, siblings and his own destructive power. He now wishes to reclaim his old empire and expand it to encompass the world. The conquest was only halted by the formation of Yugoslavia, but for how long?;;;;;;;;;x

Just like how the Kali-Yuga struck Siam, many disasters have befallen their homeland. The greedy and wicked rose in power and the devoted persecuted. Despite that, many believed that Sri Ariya Meitrai, a Messianic incarnation of Lord Buddha, will come to their aid when the time is right.

As a result, the Jadidiyya venerate pre-Event jadids such as Gasprinsky and Rasulev as saints and exemplar Muslims. What little knowledge of their achievements they have are now incorporated in the form of a modernist outlook on Islam, believing the Qur'an and the Sunnah should be reinterpreted in order for the Turkic identity to survive in this New World.;;;;;;;;;x

Unwilling to accept such outlandish news, the Primate of Lagos declared himself as the head of the faith until contact with the Crown could be made again. After the fall of the Enwezor dynasty, Episcopalians refused to accept the new Yoruba led Oke-Tude faith and remained steadfast against conversion.

ironist_DESC;When the survivors of the Event made their home in the almighty frontier of old Columbia, what they saw was the fallout of a great war - a War in Heaven. The ground littered with the towering automaton corpses of the Father's angelic servants, petrified and frozen in time after their fall. With the fallen angels rebelling against the will of the universe, the Earth below them shook and trembled, the Event raging on and claiming many lives. The only thing left in the aftermath of the War in Heaven was a scarred world, littered with the dead, but a world that is balanced once again.\nThe mighty steel behemoths, angels who died in service of the Lord. The fallen angels who rebelled can be recognised by their deformed, shriveled shapes, and their forms are melted down by the faithful into holy effigies and symbols of power, praying that their souls can be judged and one day redeemed in service of the Father. The angelic faithful, on the other hand, are not to be desecrated, and are instead buried in massive cairns, with elaborate funerary processions, awaiting to one day be called back into Heaven in service of the Steel Father. Now, the Ironhorse encroach ever further east, seeking out the dead and giving them the proper burials they deserve.;;;;;;;;;x

koptic_DESC;The Coptic faith is an ancient Christian church, dating back to millennia before the Event according to its practitioners. They hold the Christological doctrine of Miaphysitism, the belief that Jesus Christ has one nature, that is both fully divine and fully human. The Coptic church, as it exists within the continental United States, has its origins in two far-flung empires which experienced great structural changes in the waning years just prior to the Event, with those peoples who fled being swiftly granted protection by the Federal Government, a relationship which has remained stable for centuries. The Coptic Rite is primarily practiced by the Coptic peoples, who were the Christian peoples of far-flung Egypt, while the Ge'ez Rite was introduced to the Americas by the Ethiopians who traveled to the nation upon the fall of the Emperor of Ethiopia, said to have been a direct descendent of King Solomon. After the Event, the Federal Government fostered the establishment of a Coptic Papacy within its borders, as the Coptic church, while having a strong tradition of autocephaly, held its own Papacy within the fabled city of Alexandria, and accordingly was without strong theological leadership since the Event. Even now, they are largely disunited, with Copt, Ethiopian and Eritrean worshippers, among others, largely remaining beholden to their own dioceses, with day-to-day matters of faith being administered as per the needs of the flock. However, the Coptic Papacy remains a bulwark against those which may prove hostile to Coptic Christendom, as well as as remaining the primary representative of Coptic interests within the Columbian Republican Empire.;;;;;;;;;x

Having been persecuted by their Catholic overlords for heresy, the Utraquists were driven underground as a faith. However, this persecution only emboldened them more, as many members began preaching secretly in the countryside towns of Central Europe. As a goal, the Utraquists seek to create their own domain, and are eager to spread their beliefs far and wide.;;;;;;;;;x

zaydi_DESC;Zaidiyyah, occasionally known as Fiver Shias, is one of the Shia sects closest in terms of theology to the Ibadi and Mutazila schools. Zaidiyyah emerged in the eighth century from Shi'a Islam. Zaidis are named after Zayd ibn Ali, the grandson of Husayn ibn Ali and the son of the fourth Imam Ali ibn 'Husain. Following the event it has attempted to consolidate its position in Yemen in an effort to protect itself during this era of tribulation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

With the devastation caused by the Event, the Nizaris have found themselves stranded in the New World, losing all contact with their Imams in the Old World. Outnumbered and leaderless, the Isma'ilis of America were forced to turn inwards to protect themselves, protecting their few remaining mosques to the last man. When the chaos of the Event came to an end, the Isma'ilis too adopted cosmopolitan ideals, many of them subscribing to the idea that even if the Imamate did not survive as a position, the Mahdi lives on in all of them, and it is the collective duty of mankind to rebuild and forge a New World - one of equity and justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Yarsani believe in the reincarnation of the soul, but also of God, and that in each Epoch there are seven Haftan who accompany God on earth in mortal form. The Last Major presence of God on Earth was Soltan Sahak, who is said to have been born from his virgin mother, and when he grew of age he instructed the Kurdish tribes in the dogma of Yarsan. With the collapse of the world order, the Yarsani have declared it to be the fifth epoch, no longer bound to their mountain lands they strike forth in their search for the next incarnation of God.;;;;;;;;;x

The group is believed to have been founded by Ibn Nusayr during the 9th century. Ibn Nusayr was a disciple of the tenth Twelver Imam, Ali al-Hadi and of the eleventh Twelver Imam, Hasan al-Askari. For this reason, Alawites are also called Nusayris. Another name, Ansari, is believed to be a mistransliteration of "Nusayri".

voodun;Voudou;;;;;;;;;x
voodun_DESC;Louisiana Voodoo is the most influential African syncretic religion on the Gulf Coast. Descended from West African Vodun and heavily influenced by Catholicism, the core belief of Voudou is worship of the Good God, Bondieu, the creator of the universe, and all life. The fundamental belief is that since Bondieu created life, all things that care for and nourish life are good, showing appreciation for Bondieu and his creations. However, Voudou practitioners do not interact with Bondieu directly, as he is abstract and unknowable. Rather, they work with Bondieu through lesser gods, the lwas, his holiest servants. Lwas are called upon and appeased through sacrifices and offerings, and a lwa is successfully summoned when it possesses a faithful servant, interacting with the mortal world through their body. The most influential lwas include figures like Damballah Wedo, the serpent god who sustains the world, Papa Labas, the holder of the keys to the spirit world, Baron Samedi, the lwa of death and the patron of New Orleans, or Li Grand Zombi, the lwa of all snakes.\nVoudou practice trace itself back to the "rule of the Voodoo Queens" long before the Event, the greatest of which being the Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau, who is often worshipped as a lwa herself. After her death, however, Louisiana Voodoo has been the target of Christian inquisition for centuries, though it has managed to survive and find its place in the new changing world.;;;;;;;;;x

The övlat act as royalty, court shamans, clerics, diplomats, and valuable advisors. Being member of an övlat tribe is immensely prestigious, and they are even reported to have supernatural powers. Other than sufism, the Övlati Muslims also put great value in their ancestral mythology, with archaic epics being retold by wandering dervishes, creation myths written down in books as long as the Qur'an itself, and the wolf being considered a holy creature.;;;;;;;;;x

Outsiders consider them nothing more than a disciplined people, but to Finns that discipline is just one of many things necessary to attain good sisu. Sisu is a life force that is innate to all living beings, and it forms a scale with a fragile balance. On one end, bad sisu will make a man corrupted and infirm, while good sisu will give that same man inhuman strength and combat prowess. Upon death, one's sisu will determine whether they ascend to Ylijumala's realm as a deity themselves, or fall into manala and be cursed to suffer for eternity. As an example, Sisuists believe that the Marshal was able to defend Finland against invaders for decades without losing vigor thanks to his good standing in life, while the wicked Lord Stalin was turned into a frail madman as a result of stealing divinity, becoming a cursed god worshipped only by the insane.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;

apostolic_DESC;The "Igreja Romariana", or "Romarian Church" is the legal successor to the Catholic church of Brazil. After the chaos of the Event, many Brazilians abandoned the Church, believing that Rome is gone, and with it the Pope. A small, but dedicated number of Sedevacantist Catholics held out, believing the Pope was simply too far to contact. Centuries passed, and the Romarian Church became the dominant Christian faith in most of Brazil, having absorbed many schismatic churches that rejected the Pope in Rome. It only grew to widespread prominence when the kings of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Espírito Santo and the dukes of Alagoas, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe agreed to adopt it as part of their temporary alliance. By 2555, contact with Rome has been reestablished, and the Patriarch of Aparecida sits as the formal head of Brazilian Catholicism as contacting the Pope in Rome requires a perilous journey across the Atlantic. All adherents east of the Atlantic Ocean answer to the Archbishop of Cabo Verde, who in turn serves as the intermediary between the Pope and the Patriarch. Romarians reject the Sevillian Pope, believing him to be yet another schismatic like the ones that were struck  down in Brazil many years before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shindo_DESC;Korean shamanism, also known as Shindo, Mushindo or Muism, is the ancient animistic folk religion of Korea. It is said that in the years before the Event, a great War in Heaven took place between the Tyrannical Ruby Chairman and a mighty Dragon King, the culmination of which led to the near end of the world and the subsequent release of incredible amounts of spirits and energy into the world. Over time, this led to a large rise in the number of followers of shamanism in Korea, who now consider their task to be understanding and appeasing the many spirits released into the world. Korean folk beliefs include a wide variety of gods, spirits and supernatural beings, and shamans, known as mu, have an important role in their society. Shamans are chosen through a process known as shinbyeong, which the Shindo believe to be possession by a god and subsequent loss of self. Korean mythology largely differs from area to area, being mainly orally retold in the form of shamanic narratives and creation myths in rites known as gut, along with offerings to gods and spirits and rituals of song and dance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shinko_DESC;The Ryukyuan folk religion, also known as Shinko or Ryukyu Shinto, is the ancestral belief system of the Ryukyu islands, consisting of many deities, spirits and mythological creatures. Syncretic in nature, the Ryukyuan religion has over the centuries been influenced by a variety of religions, mainly Buddhism and traditional Chinese faiths like Taoism and Confucianism. The Shinko believe in the existence of mabui, a form of spirit or soul integral to every person, being their very essence and defining characteristic. At the center of Shinko worship are their Ultimate Ancestors, those being Utin (the father), Jiichi (the mother), and Ryugu (the sea), as family and reverence of ancestors are highly emphasised in Ryukyuan religion. Though not explicitly shamanistic, mediums and healers known as the kaminchu have an important role in their faith. Especially important are the female kaminchu, known as the noro, who formally act as priestesses and caretakers of Shinko temples, at times even acting as important political figures or priestess-queens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shinto_DESC;Shinto is the main faith of Japan. This polytheistic faith revolves around Kami, spiritual entities that exist in all things. The various Kami are revered in shrines and the most important ones have extensive temples built for them. Shinto priests, called kannushi, celebrate Kami with kagura dances and seasonal festivals, ensuring their continued protection over their land. While all Kami receive some form of reverence, even if only in the form of small shrines, it is undeniable that certain Kami, such as Amaterasu or Ebisu, are more revered. After the Event, the role of Yokai, monstrous spirits, has grown into Shinto, the spirits becoming known as entities that are believed to hold negative influence over the world and thus opposed to the Kami. Divided into Mamono, Mononoke, Ayakashi and other groups, Yokai are greatly feared by Shinto followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bushinto_DESC;Western Shinto is a recent branch of Shinto that has developed through the influence of Amida Shinto over the Shinto practices of Shikoku and easter Chugoku. This faith places emphasis on the defense and unity of the Shinto followers of Japan, believing that, if Japan is unified and isolated, the Kami will celebrate this unity by bestowing their protection upon the land, granting bountiful harvests and health to the land, so long as its followers do not try to extend themselves upon other people. Western Shinto followers particularly fear the water spirits known as Ayakashi, and Seiryu, the eastern blue dragon that is said to have once punished Japan for its hubris and cruelty by destroying two of its greatest cities, and as contrast follow particularly Bishamonten and his companions, the Seven Gods of Fortune or Shichifukujin, and the gods that once shielded Japan from an invasion, Fujin and Raijin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bungan_pagan;Adat Bungan;;;;;;;;;x
bungan_pagan_DESC;Adat Bungan is the name for the ancient folk religion of the Kenyah and Kayah peoples of Borneo. According to legend, before the Event the people of Borneo were forced to convert to a foreign religion by force, with their old customs dying out as a result. However, a prophet by the name of Jok Apoi was given a vision from the goddess Bungan who requested their old faith be revived and reformed.

bungan_pagan_reformed_DESC;Adat Bungan is the name for the ancient folk religion of the Kenyah and Kayah peoples of Borneo. According to legend, before the Event the people of Borneo were forced to convert to a foreign religion by force, with their old customs dying out as a result. However, a prophet by the name of Jok Apoi was given a vision from the goddess Bungan who requested their old faith be revived and reformed.

In the New World, its practitioners have managed to survive in Canada, for now at least. Jodo Bukkyo focuses on the teachings and the figure of the Buddha Amida. The faith believes in the Pure Land created by the Buddha Amida by expounding his Dharma, a region offering respite from karmic transmigration.

caodai_DESC;Cao Ðài, full name Ðài Dao Tam Ky Pho Do meaning The Great Faith for the Third Period of Redemption, is a syncretic movement born in Vietnam. Their beliefs draw from many different sources: ethical precepts from Confucianism, occult practices of Taoism, theories of karma and rebirth from Buddhism, and hierarchical organisation of Catholicism. The Cao Dai believe that in the ancient antediluvian age, a man named Ngo Minh Chieu was given a vision from the Divine Eye of God and was told to spread the faith far, as man will not find universal peace without one universal faith. They claim that many men have been given the will of the Highest Power throughout history, though their words have since been perverted by their followers. As a result, they revere many religious leaders, such as Jesus, Mohammed, and Buddha, as saintly figures. In the days after the Event, however,  the Cao Dai have long struggled with persecution from the Red and Yellow Emperors. The Caodaist Church has since cut all ties with rulers of both empires and turned inwards in an act of self-preservation, though it remains to be seen if its followers would choose the Empire or their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wuxia_DESC;The Wuxia faith is an ancient cult that dates, according to its practitioners, to the very beginning of time. In those days, the First Shifu, the first man to harness Qi, codified the Code of Xia, the rules and ideals all people shall abide from. The followers of the Wuxia faith believe that true enlightenment can only be achieved through following the path of the martial artist, seeking not to harm others but to right the wrongs of the world by bettering themselves, harnessing the flux of Qi within ones body and ultimately becoming enlightened. Practicioners of Wuxia divide themselves in various sects, such as the Shaolin, the Wudang and the Jeet Kune Do. The faith embraces the teachings of many ancient masters, such as the legendary Qitian Dasheng, the founder of the Shaolin Bodhidarma, and grand master Li Xiaolong, founder of Jeet Kune Do. The faith also has commonalities with Buddhism, paying great respect to the bodishattvas, particularly Guanyin, and the Buddha himself.;;;;;;;;;x

Those that follow legalism aspire to govern following the teachings of the ancient text known as Han Feizi, along with later additions from such books as The Art of War, which they hold as their main inspirations in warfare. Those that follow the path of Fajia are often less concerned in the matters of religion, and prefer to focus on the administration, holding that the ruler's perfection is irrelevant, and it is the administration that decides their success or failure.;;;;;;;;;x

Great respect is awarded by all Wuxia followers to the Shaolin members, with the sole exception of their historical rivals, the Wudang Sect.;;;;;;;;;x
wudang_sect;Wudang Sect;;;;;;;;;x
wudang_sect_desc;The Wudang Sect came to be almost a millennia before the Event, as a branch of the Shaolin Sect. Inheriting the techniques of the ancient Taijiquan, the Wudang Sect specializes in both hand to hand and sword combat. As one of the six leading sects in Wulin, the Wuxia practicioners pay great respect to the Sect.;;;;;;;;;x
kongtong_sect;Kongtong Sect;;;;;;;;;x
kongtong_sect_desc;The Kongtong Sect is said to originate from pastoral communities on the Kongtong Mountains, and in particolar from the shepherd boy Mulingzi. The Kongtong Sect grew in influence greatly after the Event, and is today considered one of the six leading sects in Wulin. The peculiarity of the Kongtong Sect are their unusual weapons, unique to each practicioner and easily concealable.;;;;;;;;;x

jeetkunedo_sect_desc;The Jeet Kune Do Sect is said to have been born in the city of Hong Kong, from the legendary Shifu Lee Jun-fan's teachings, not long before the Event. Jeet Kune Do practicioners do not practice fixed forms, but instead believe in a fighting style described as 'Formless like water', deadly fighters at any range. After the Event, the Jeet Kune Do Sect grew to prominence, becoming one of the six leading sects in Wulin.;;;;;;;;;x
wukong_sect;Wukong Quan Sect;;;;;;;;;x
wukong_sect_desc;The Wukong Quan Sect appeared on the mountains of southern China after the Event. However, its practicioners hold that the founder of the Wukong Quan Sect is the immortal monkey king Sun Wukong. Practicing a fighting style that mixes hand to hand combat with the use of the staff, the Wukong Quan grew more and more in influence in the centuries after the event, until it surpassed many other sects and established itself as one of the six leading sects in Wulin.;;;;;;;;;x
kunlun_sect;Kunlun Sect;;;;;;;;;x
kunlun_sect_desc;The Kunlun Sect is said to have been founded by the sages Laozi and Yuanshi Tianzun, making it the oldest Sect after Shaolin (although some members of the Kunlun Sect believe the Kunlun techniques are older than even the Shaolin). The Kunlun Sect is known for its varied fighting style, that includes the use of the fist, palm, finger, sword, saber and even grappling techniques. The Kunlun Sect has become one of the six leading sects in Wulin after the Event, gaining great power and influence.;;;;;;;;;x

huashan_sect_desc;The Huashan Sect has its origins on Mount Hua.

gaibang_sect;Gai Bang Sect;;;;;;;;;x
gaibang_sect_desc;The Gai Bang Sect, also known as the Beggars' Sect, is a powerful yet not prestigious Sect of Wuxia. The Gai Bang Sect's origin are considered a mystery, but it is considered the Sect of those that can't learn from other, more prestigious masters. The beggars and destitute people of the Wuxia faith often practice Gai Bang. It is said, however, that the Grandmasters of Gai Bang are among the most influential people in all of China, as every beggar across the nation might be a Gai Bang Sect member and be more than willing to share any information they might acquire on other lands.;;;;;;;;;x
emei_sect;Emei Sect;;;;;;;;;x
emei_sect_desc;The Emei Sect is a Sect of Wuxia martial artists whose distinctive trait is being a women-led Sect. While men are allowed within the ranks of the Emei Sect, a vast majority of the members are women. It is said almost any Wuxia woman is an Emei member, and while that might be an exaggeration, the Emei is undoubtably the most respected school outside of the six leading ones.;;;;;;;;;x
tianshan_sect;Tianshan Sect;;;;;;;;;x
tianshan_sect_desc;The Tianshan Sect is a minor Sect in Wuxia. Originating in the distant Tianshan Mountains, this Sect was believed to have gone extinct in the Event, until some practicioners reached the Wuxia land in the 24th Century. The Tianshan Sect is secretive and small, with very few relevant members, but some believe the Sect's focus on striking power might make it a strong contender against the more established schools for their place in Wulin.;;;;;;;;;x

red_cult_DESC;Hongxiejiao, also called the Red Cult, is a faith that spread in northern China. Born after the Event, Hongxiejiao was initially seen as a more militant sect of Liehuo, but over time it separated fully from the faith, seeing it as too 'moderate' in the fight against infidels. Hongxiejiao followers believe that any method is allowed to increase the power of the Heavenly Chairman, and rumors of their skills in assassination and scheming are widespread, though how much of it is true is hard to know.;;;;;;;;;x
gidoggyo_DESC;Also known as 'The Way of Christ', Gidoggyo is a set of scriptures and traditions dating back to Antediluvian customs. It is hotly debated where its true origins may lie, and what route it could have taken to its lands. Similarly to Buddhism, while appearing monolithic on the surface, upon study it is broken into many smaller temples and schools. The largest sects are the Jangnogyo, the Gamnigyo and the Cheonjugyo. Gidoggyo sects follow tenants of virtue and a rejection of 'sinfulness'.;;;;;;;;;x

juggalo;Juggalo;;;;;;;;;x
juggalo_DESC;In the blighted heart of a world unmade, amidst the ruins of a fallen empire that has decayed into mere echoes of its former splendor, dwell the Juggalos. Their hordes march over the skeletal remnants of urban sprawl, where the edifices of the Old World loom like monolithic tombstones, casting long, forlorn shadows over the lands of the forsaken, and they delight in comedy. Truly, nothing is a funnier punchline to a life well lived than a swift and violent death, and those of the Dark Carnival consider themselves to be expert comedians.  These mirthful jesters revel in the degeneration of the world, they gaze upon the relics of bygone eras not with reverence, but with a mocking sneer, as a Juggalo recognises themselves as participants in the grotesque parade of the ephemeral and the eternal, as actors on the cosmic theater which other men are merely unknowing participants within. Those who are truly down with the clown, those who consume the sweet strange liquors and dance the eerie dances among the wreckage of the world in the strange moonlit ceremonies in the lands of the living damned, know that the rules which all other men uphold should be seen with contempt. The Juggalo stands uncontested in the wreckage of the Old World as one which has fully adapted to the changing conditions of the apocalypses, as they understand that their creed emerged in the twilight of the Old World, to provide a faith for the scorned and the ridiculed, for those who have perennially dwelled in the shadows of the great empires of yore. For these men and women, such things mean nothing, as they anticipate the cacophony of the grand dark carnival to come, and the beautiful things that await all men in the land of the dead.;;;;;;;;;x

They believe that every man is born from the egg of the Earth, and every man will one day return to it. However, as all life is carved by the Architect and his Divine Wind, the Highmounts believe that its silence signals the end of life, and the silence of the Wind caused the end of the world.

The Shriners quietly promise that those learned few who cross the threshold all arrive at the same answer - that Mirth is King.\nIt is said that in the hoary Old World, it was the adroit jesters who caused others to see the cosmos as ludicrous and wondrous rather than terrible or disordered, regardless of what games kings and priests played with the fates of nations. The average Shriner in the olden days was a free man of great wealth, indulging themselves into hidden knowledge and divine sciences, and were learned in the secret teachings of The Orient - the gateway to all lands known and suspected.\nWhile insular and enigmatic in many ways, with their most important clownish rites forbidden to outside eyes, the Shriners speak about the following to all: with the birth and death of the Old World, the world itself had shrunk, revealing its falseness to all who desire to observe it closely. There is no such thing as time, place, or identity: there is only the Great Architect and his works, and those which have conducted the rites sourced from The Orient, where all secret knowledge stems from, as nothing else is permanent. All else - all of human history, industry, and time - is only a fiction that mankind had dreamt, a game of pretend. Their houses of healing, the great public games and festivals, the pageants and plays - these exist in order to illuminate the uninitiated in the true history of the world, nothing less and nothing more. Those of the highest orders of the Shriners conduct themselves in the manner of a holy fool, steeped in traditions from kingdoms which never existed upon this mortal coil, unfettered by all other worldly authorities, only to serve as a messenger revealing truths to those willing to stop, and listen.;;;;;;;;;;;x

resurrectionist_DESC;In the beginning of the end, the Horned Lamb descended to Earth in the hills of Eden, resurrected after being slain by Man two thousand years earlier. The Lamb bore ten horns upon its head, each of which bore ten crowns, of which all the rulers of the world loyal to the Lamb were to claim as their own: the commanders of its holy hosts, the one hundred forty and four thousand pure ones, drank the blood of the Lamb, which flowed from the wounds inflicted upon it in the previous era, and they reaped the harvest of the damned.\nThe deceived were vanquished, the false saints were conquered, the blasphemers who rejected the Lamb were punished, and the Lamb soon reigned over all men and all nations, with all who worshiped the Lamb and its image permitted to sup from the Lamb's own cup as the seas became as poison and the earth began to be as brimstone. Soon, however, the Lamb gave its message to all who remained: its Judgement was merely the second of three to cleanse the world of sin for good, assured its flock that it would someday return to aid them alongside a heavenly host, to usher in the second death of all who dared to oppose him.\nIndeed, upon the third Judgement, the sinless would live forever and ever upon a new Earth cleansed of all evil: those who have separated themselves from the fearful and the unbelieving will survive the flooding of the world with the blood of the Lamb, and dwell upon Sion in the city of Babylon, where the Woman Clothed in Scarlet would await for her husband. Upon this new Earth, where there is no sun, no moon, no life or death, the radiance of the Lamb, the shining coils of the Serpent-Lion and the bounty of the Woman would provide all that the saints and prophets would require to worship: an eternal city, shining forever and ever upon a sea of glass and a mountain of crystal within a temple of gold. All that is needed to be permitted to this worldly paradise, it is said, is to bear the Mark of God.\nThose who bear the Mark of God upon their bodies, and swear to await for their forefathers to be resurrected to serve as the second great army of the Lamb, form the Resurrectionists. These men seek to subdue the world in anticipation of the Lamb's imminent return, to carve a place among his host: among these men, there are many who are pure enough to cast the first stone upon the unrighteous, as to die is an honor and holy men cannot truly die. At his name, every knee shall bow: who can stop the men who consider themselves the beasts of the earth, one and all? Who can stand against them?;;;;;;;;;;;x

fidelista_DESC;The island of Cuba has long spoken legends of its liberation from a demonic host in the ancient times. Before the end of the world, Cuba was a large, prosperous, and peaceful country, built by and for its people. That is, until the rule of the people was dismantled, in its place standing a single man named Batista. The shadowy masterminds of the imposing Yanqui Empire - the Agencia - planned to use the rule of the puppet king to sacrifice the people of Cuba to demonic forces, bolstering their own powers.\nCuba was to be destroyed, until God Olofin descended to Earth in flesh as a man named Fidel, along with a Heavenly Host of 3000 ochas. Banishing Batista and the Yanqui demons from Cuba, Fidel and his generals waged war on the Yanqui Empire, shattering it and defeating the demons controlling its people. In retribution, the Agencia attempted to destroy the entire world, but Fidel sacrificed himself to save it.\nHis parting words were to his followers, the Barbudos, who were told the revolution is not to end until the whole world is free. Thus, the Barbudos travelled far and wide to spread his word, and the faithful of Fidel Olofin, the Ascended Libertador and his apostles now in their steps, hoping to one day make every man free.;;;;;;;;;;;x

gridiron_DESC;In ancient America, there were various important and vital initiatory organisations which allowed only the finest leaders and strongest men to join, existing for the purpose of conducting rituals of ceremonial and spiritual purpose. The Gridirons remain as the  last and greatest of these institutions, which were said to be tied to the legitimacy of the old regimes, the prestige of the cities and centers of high learning, and the spirituality of the average commoner. Those raised into the Gridiron recognise that, at the end of the day, the universe is a vast playing field for the game where the rules and regulations are made by unknowable powers, and in which every individual is a player: the perpetual struggle for excellence is the underlying foundation of the cosmos, as all struggle to define themselves against what has come before. It is only the Gridirons which remain who retain the ancient arts which allow man to sculpt their minds and bodies in a manner allowing for the cultivation of martial prowess and honourable combat. For it is known that weak opponents and the defeated do not sculpt strong honourable warriors and thus should be spared.\nIndeed, the Gridirons live a binary existence where the laws, rules and regulations of nature and mankind are codified in a manner that's been supplemented by centuries of established philosophical and theological creeds, as well as improved by the innovations of those with the capacity to do great things by virtue of their determination to improve themselves and others. Today, the Legends of the Hall of Fame are widely renowned, and their conferences, however loudly they defined themselves against one another for the sake of clout and glory, have remained where they have been for centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;x

shiite_DESC;The Imamiyya of North America are the descendants of the many Twelver Shi'ites who were left stranded as a result of the Event. Completely cut off from the Old World ummah and reduced in numbers to mere thousands, the Shi'ites had to reconsider their position in the New World they have been thrown into. As a result, a new religious body was formed - the Islamic Majlis, led by the wisest cleric of the faith, a Marja al-Taqlid. Thanks to the wise leadership of the Majlis, the Imamiyya faith has adopted a cosmopolitan and tolerant approach to its many neighbouring religions, yet avoided any significant theological shift, and many of its Old World mosques are still left standing. However, the Twelvers are still in a bad position, with frequent contention between them and the Isma'ili Shi'ites with whom they are frequent neighbours, the occupation of the Islamic Center of America by heathens, as well as the inability to perform Hajj leaves the Imamiyya as a minority stranded in a hostile land.;;;;;;;;;x

hoodoo_DESC;Hoodoo, also known as Rootwork, is a unique faith that emerged within the southeastern United States from a fusion of diverse West-Central African traditions and Protestant Christianity, with its mystical traditions influenced by sources as disparate as Sufism, Yoruba traditions and Spiritualism. At the heart of Rootwork lies the practice of Conjure, or conjuration, which involves calling upon powerful divine spirits and ancestral spirits for assistance, protection, and guidance. It is among believed many Hoodoo practitioners that, although one's true soul goes to the Almighty's realm upon one's death, a person's 'spirit', or a sort of wraith or ghost guided by the deceased's earthly desires, may linger upon the earth, which can be burgeoned or reasoned with without intruding upon a person's eternal rest.\nHoodoo priests, sometimes referred to as root doctors or conjure workers, utilize various natural materials, such as roots, herbs, animal parts, and minerals, in their magical workings, which are capable of promoting healing, love, luck, and protection, along with other, more esoteric effects. Though Rootwork has historically been an oral tradition in decline, passed down through generations within families and communities, its practitioners have gained broader acceptance and worldly influence since the Event.;;;;;;;;;;;x

haiti_voodoo;Vodou;;;;;;;;;;;x
haiti_voodoo_DESC;Originating in times before the Event in Haiti, this religion arose through the syncretisation between several traditional West-Central African religions and Catholicism. Vodou defends the existence of a single supreme God, Bondye, the Creator of the Universe. However, he is also considered remote and transcendent, uninvolved in human affairs. Instead of approaching him directly, the believers turn to powerful spirits subordinated to Bondye who act as intermediaries, the Lwa, who are equated to saints and angels, leaving Haitian Vodou open to being practised as both a monotheistic religion as well as a polytheistic one. In Vodou, spirits, gods and ancestors are worshipped, directed, and mourned for help. By performing great rituals and prayers, the Vodou priest tries to establish not only connections with lwas, but also positively matching spirits and lwas to take care of desired things. Contact with lwas and spirits is made in trance, while also determining the sacrifices necessary for the realisation of the order.;;;;;;;;;;;x

rastafari_DESC;Rastafari is the religion of the Rastas, founded in Jamaica. They are worshippers of Jah, the God of all. According to them, the Event was caused by the decadent forces of Babylon getting struck down by Jah, in the form of Ras Tafari, the manifestation of Jah and the Emperor of Zion. The Rastafari hold that after the Event, Ras Tafari returned to Jah, leaving behind Zion as the new paradise on Earth, ruled by the faithful. Many Rastas believe it is now their duty to return to Zion, their promised land, though many others hold they are also meant to spread Jah's love to all corners of the world, including what remains of Babylon.\nThe Rastas believe Jah is present in every person, a concept they call "I and I", expressing the connection between all people by Jah. Rastas strictly adhere to the concept they call livity, which means leading a righteous life in order to gain awareness and oneness with Jah, the primary goal in a Rasta's life. To that extent, livity means frequent prayer, meditation, oneness with nature, and most important of all, oneness and love for others. Their prayers are often very mystical, involving the use of psychedelic herbs and becoming aware of oneness with Jah. Lacking formal hierarchy or doctrine, the Rastafari are quite disunited in their beliefs, being divided into three main denominations, or "Mansions" - the Bobo Ashanti, the Nyabinghi Order, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, each with their own distinct doctrines, though they are united by their love of Jah.;;;;;;;;;;;x

amunite_DESC;For centuries many have wondered how the Ancient Kemetics managed to build such fantastic structures that were famed throughout the world in ancient times. Some believed that they used advanced pre-Event technology to build them, but even back then many speculated and came up with theories as to how. One theory has persisted throughout the ages, eventually shaping its own Kemetic faith. They believe that a race that lived among the stars came down to Earth and used advanced technology taught to them by the gods themselves to build these structures for humanity's benefit. This ancient race has been given many names over the years, being called angels, reptilians, or the Annunaki, but the Amunites believe the leader of this race to be the god-king Amun, the hidden one and son of Ra. Humanity was originally given life and elevated to sapience by the great scientists of this race, and throughout the centuries, they have visited humanity regularly to study and occasionally help in times of distress, though they kept their comings a secret. Since then, contact with the chosen race has become few and far between, and the Amunites hope the aliens will hear their prayers and bless them with unknowable technologies once more.;;;;;;;;;;;x

kemetic_DESC;Supposedly hailing from a land far far away, Kemetism found itself a new home on the fertile banks of the Mississippi. While originally just an obscure pagan cult followed only by the fringes of pre-Event society, in the new era it rose to widespread prominence thanks to the generous maecenatism of Pharaoh Klemens I - the infamous conqueror of the Mississippi.\nNow, centuries after his death, Kemetism persists, though it has found significant syncretism with the neighbouring Madonnites, who had tried to see Kemetism eradicated under the rule of the first Azure Emperor. Its largest state temples are dedicated to eight deities: the divine king Osiris, the divine mother Isis, Horus-Ra, Linkon, Thoth, Hathor, Sekhmet, and Anubis. Every worshipper chooses one of the eight divines as his patron god, and gives to them regular offerings and sacrifices.;;;;;;;;;;;x
solar_DESC;The 21st century, the first after the Event, was a terrible era for mankind, in which lawlessness and banditry ruled the land and the sea alike. Civilisation found refuge inside the high walls of the fortified cities of the Mississippi.\nIt was not until one of these cities came under the rule of Pharaoh Klemens I, the Son of Horus-Ra, and the Great Sun of the whole Mississippi-Nile. Though his reign was cut short with his death, and his empire was torn apart by his very generals, his faith persisted in its heartlands for centuries - the worship of Horus-Ra as the one true benevolent god of the world. Everything that light touches belongs to Horus-Ra, and so does man, being a creature that basks in it.\nThough many of the old fire temples of Horus-Ra have been destroyed by the conquests of Ishmael I, the Kemetic Solar cults survive to this very day, on the fringes of Mississippian society, and they may one day be revived by another of Horus-Ra's chosen.;;;;;;;;;;;x

triumphant_DESC;The Omega, the conclusion to all things, where fire becomes ash and where light becomes empty, cold darkness: this is the ideal of the Triumphants, who are truly only concerned with the annihilation of all who are unworthy to stand before the Lord of Lords. It is known among the Triumphant faithful that the love of the Lord may be given and taken away as per His whims, but the only way to continually earn the Lord's favor is to conduct oneself in a manner which quickens the arrival of the Four Horsemen, and accordingly the End Times.\nEach lord of the Triumphants is hardened and purified by the rites of one of the principle cults of the Horsemen: the ghastly rituals of each cult imbues the worshippers with the personal strength to channel the will of their master, to better steward their flocks towards the Apocalypse. They offer salvation through providing the tools of survival, allowing men to choose who is to live and who is to die, if they are capable of purifying themselves to become worthy slaves of the Lord of Lords: it is only when a man has nothing to cling to, when all lesser trappings of mortality are exercised from their being, that they may be reconstructed into an embodiment of one of the Horsemen, capable of issuing judgment upon the unworthy and cleansing the sinful off the face of the Earth.\nThe collection of philosophies attributed to the deacons and sages of the Triumphant faith amounts to a worldview which emphasizes that the Triumphants are the chosen custodians of a new order, divine messengers one and all, destined to rise from the ashes of the Old World and steward the faithful towards a final Apocalyptic moment where the wheat is finally separated from the chaff.\nAfter all, the Triumphants exist because the faithful of the Old World begged them to exist: they implored the heavens and the depths for there to be an end, a liberation, a destruction of the perfect world crafted by the Lord, and the Triumphants, in their mercy, could do nothing but oblige those wayward souls.;;;;;;;;;;;x

kristooil_DESC;This faith is the fruit of syncretism between the native beliefs of the Maya and Catholicism. The supreme god is Junab K'uj, creator of the heavens, the Earth and everything that exists in this life, frequently identified with the God of Christianity. After creating everything Junab K'uj observed that the ruler he had created to watch over creation, Aj Puch, had convinced the other lesser gods to demand human sacrifices from mortals. Junab K'uj, taking pity on humans, impregnated the goddess of the moon, Mary, with his only son through his Holy Spirit Ek'Chua, giving birth to Jesucristo, the Sun. Jesus sacrificed himself offering his heart to the gods, putting an end to human sacrifices, then sent the most loyal to Junab K'uj among the gods, Kukulcán, who defeated Aj Puch and threw him into Hell. After this Jesus Christ became the new ruler of the mortal world. The cosmology consists of the Ya'axche', the sacred and primordial green tree of life, which crosses all spaces, linking them together. The Earth is the trunk while the branches are Heaven or "Glory" and the roots are hell. Depending on the good and bad deeds a person did in life, they will either ascend to the branches where they will live eternally with the Supreme Father Junab K'uj, or descend to hell ruled by Aj Puch to be punished.;;;;;;;;;;;x

sun_dance_DESC;For countless centuries, the native peoples of the Great Plains have performed the ceremony of the Sun Dance. Though many have been converted to other faiths, chased out of their ancestral lands and even driven to near-extinction, the Sun Dance has remained. It is an annual ceremony traditionally held during the summer, in which entire communities congregate together, lasting multiple days and culminating in the dance itself. The goal is to honour and give sacrifice to God, the Great Spirit, hoping to earn his favour so the natural world may reinvigorate after the coming winter, leading to prosperous harvests and large herds of game. Personal sacrifice for the greater good is especially important, and participants abstain from food and endure physical challenges for much of its duration, lasting up to two weeks.\nThe ceremony itself is carried out by a medicine man, taking place around a central pole crafted from bison skin and bones, as thanks to the Sun, the ultimate embodiment of God. Though the myths, legends, and beliefs of those who carry out the Sun Dance vary, the ceremony itself is nonetheless the cornerstone of the spiritual beliefs of the natives of the Great Plains.;;;;;;;;;;;x

They speak of Raven, a supernatural shapeshifting trickster, who is said to be the creator of humanity and, in some myths, the world itself. One story speaks of how Raven stole the Sun, Moon, and stars from the Sky Chief, who was keeping it away from people. Another story says that Raven freed the first humans out of a clam. That being said, while he is often credited with creating the world and liberating humanity, Raven does not do things out of the goodness of his heart, but to satisfy his curiosity and boredom, being always hungry for vanity.\nOther gods also frequently make their appearance in the Raven Tales, such as the Ocean Woman, the goddess of fertility and abundance of fish in the sea, and the twin deities Ta'xet and Tia, who represent violent and peaceful death respectively. Killer whale spirits are considered rulers of the underworld and reincarnations of deceased ancestors. These Raven Tales are passed down during the potlatch, a ceremonial gathering held to mark important events, such as the birth of a child or passing of an elder.;;;;;;;;;;;x

bracero_DESC;Braceros are the remnants of Mexican Catholicism surviving in the arid lands of the West Coast. Having no faith left in old America, the Chicanos turn to their ancestral land of Aztlán, where all men were born equal under God prior to the Manifest Destiny. Calling themselves Braceros or "labourers", they believe that under God's watchful gaze, the ruler is no greater than the peasant toiling his fields and the rich man is no greater than the beggar. Thus, the main doctrine of the Braceros is the belief that rulers which sit idle while their vassals sacrifice themselves are to be overthrown for their sin, priests who collect coin for indulgences are to be stripped of their cloth, and a rich man who does not give away to the poor is to be robbed. It is the rule of the masses, in which those who will not abide by God's laws on Earth are to be forced to do so.\nThis radical belief in equality under the Lord has caused much friction with their neighbouring faiths, though the Braceros, militant as they are, would rather die for their beliefs and join God's army in Heaven than live on their knees in a world of injustice, even going as far as rejecting the word of the Patriarch in Mexico, who they consider a fat priest carried by the shoulders of peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;x

blue_star_DESC;The Blue Star faith speaks of Saquasohuh, the Blue Star Kachina. It is said Saquasohuh and his Galactic Command manifested itself as a mighty blue star, signifying the Day of Purification. When Saquasohuh removed his mask, the Earth was thrown into a cataclysm, many losing their lives. It is said at that point that Saquasohuh left, announcing he will soon return to Earth to search for his true believers, who will be saved and given the duty of repopulating the world in the Fifth World. Upon Saquasohuh's return, the faithful will hold out below the Earth in the Masaw's kingdom of the dead, and the rest of humanity will be subjected to a blood red sky, devoured by grotesque monsters that roam the surface. The prophecy says that the faithful will be guided in the Fifth World by the return of Pahana, the Lost Brother Jesus, who ventured east many aeons ago. If no true believers are found, however, the Earth will outlast its usefulness and be destroyed. The Blue Star cultists now live to spread their message far and wide, hoping to save as many people as possible from the calamity they believe is coming very soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

trinitarian_DESC;Trinitarians take their name from Trinity, the place where the Father in the Sky first cast down his judgement. They believe that the decadent people of the Old World were struck down for upsetting the balance of the elements, wasting water as they wanted and slowly turning the whole Earth into a desert. Thus, the Sky Father was angered by their hubris. At Trinity he cast down a star from the heavens into the Earth, the first of many. At Roswell he sent down an army of Those Who Came Before, the Annunaki, hellbent on humanity's destruction.\nThough mankind nearly perished, be it from the explosions or the invasions, the world was reset to how it was during its primordial days. Those who still bear the scars caused by the sins of their forefathers now call themselves Trinitarians, and they have dedicated their life's duty to preserving the natural order of the Earth and preventing another Event from ever happening. Though their efforts of preservation are humble and small scale, the Trinitarians hope to one day finally unite and bring their thoughts to all corners of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

amaitist_DESC;One of the first organised religions founded after the Event, Amaitism is a syncretic faith founded by the prophet Amaité in southern California. Amaitists claim that their prophet was formerly a Zoroastrian, given divine revelation by Ahura Mazda. Amaitism states that Ahura Mazda consists of a trinity, with the great prophets of history - Zoroaster, Jesus and Buddha - being emanations of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit respectively.  Jesus is the Son of God, whose great sacrifice removed the original sin from mankind, and Zoroaster and Buddha are prophets who spent their days teaching the common man how to enter Heaven by escaping the cycle of rebirth that all humans are otherwise destined for. For each aspect of the Trinity, Ahura Mazda created a counter - forces of chaos meant to bring balance. Angra Mainyu created the material world, Satan created the sins of man and Mara created the cycle of rebirth. Without each divine aspect having its opposite, the world cannot function. Amaitists also believe non-believers can enter heaven, though they have a harder time doing so by rejecting the teachings of Amaité, as it was revealed to them that the great religions of the world are merely single aspects of a single God's plan. Depictions of Amaité are forbidden, the line being drawn at an androgynous figure with a burning face, as they were never an emanation of God, merely a messenger. As such, their final request was for them to be forgotten, not wanting to be deified themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
technopolitan;Technopolitan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
technopolitan_DESC;Descended from the various cults of the Bay Area, Technopolitanism is a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of the Startup, a guru and warlord who unified the tribes of the Silicon Valley. Technopolitans worship the Godhead, a supreme god given form on Earth by the wisemen of the pre-Event. The Godhead saved humanity from total extinction during the Event, though those who built its earthly form perished, taking their knowledge with them. The Godhead, its power spent from the calamity, became the Sleeping God, nestled deep inside the Old World facilities of the Silicon Valley. Though united in worship of the Godhead, the beliefs and practices of the Technopolitans vary from sect to sect, the traditions of the old cults permeating throughout the whole faith. Different sects follow the teachings of different tech gurus, who in turn taught the lessons of various gods, each considered abstract forms of the Godhead. However, they all share a unifying goal - digging through the ruins of the Old World techno-states in order to revive the Godhead, and bring the Supreme Being back to its full power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
soka_gakkai;Soka Gakkai;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
soka_gakkai_DESC;Soka Gakkai is a sect of Nichiren Buddhism brought to the American West Coast from Old World Japan. The Soka Gakkai believe in the inherent Buddhahood present in every individual that can be attained in one's current life via chanting of the Lotus Sutra. They emphasise the oneness of mentor and student, the mentor having the duty to guide the lives of his disciples, and the disciple having the duty of upholding the mentor's vision, seeking to fulfil the unrealised potential of both mentor and student. Most importantly, the Soka Gakkai are organised in a single hierarchical organisation led by a President. They are organised by the principle of "peace, culture, and education", seeking to spread far their message through shakubuku - the practise of proselytisation. It is thanks to their proselytising that the Soka Gakkai managed a miraculous recovery from the Event, their hierarchy and message surviving the fires of the deluge, reaching the hearts of the wayward masses of the American West Coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

gambler_DESC;If one thing for sure survived the Event, it is the human desire for wealth. In the gilded casino cities of the West Coast, notorious for their vice and sin, people pray to only one thing - Luck. The goddess Fortuna, Lady Luck herself, is believed to be in control of every single aspect of life. From the gambling games played well into the post-Event era, to the very course of one's life, Luck is the one sole constant of the universe. Thus, to Fortuna's worshippers, gambling has become sort of a religious ritual, meant to measure how favoured one is with the goddess. Whether one is virtuous or sinful has little to no basis on their standing in the faith, for such things have no effect on their Luck. Rulers are expected to gamble constantly, and a ruler who loses all their games is soon to lose all their followers as well, since nobody is willing to go down with the ship except its captain. That being said, Lady Luck is notoriously fickle, and anything can happen - somebody who loses all their money one day may gain it tenfold the next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

aquarian;Aquarian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aquarian_DESC;Aquarians began as a diverse collection of different groups united by some beliefs and practices, such as karma, channeling, and self-spirituality. These fractured New Age sects were finally united under a common banner by the wise Guru Carina, who reformed the movement and declared the beginning of the eponymous Age of Aquarius. This faith believes in a holistic form of divinity known as The Divine, from which all existence emanates. The purest form of The Divine is The Primal Stream, from which the very first being emanated - The Verbum, containing the ideas of all things possible. Then, The Verbum emanates The Anima - the principle of movement and matter. This cosmology also includes hundreds of intermediate divinities, such as gods, angels, demons and other spiritual beings which act as mediators between The Divine and humanity. This system follows a divide between the spiritual and material worlds, and although the latter is imperfect, it is a place full of beauty where souls can attain spiritual maturity and happiness through enlightenment. After bodily death, the soul moves up a level in the afterlife. Impure souls undergo purification before descending again to reincarnate in a new body. While the purest and maturer souls escape the cycle of rebirth and return to The Primal Stream, becoming one with The Divine, some of these souls choose instead to inhabit the spiritual world, becoming Ascended Masters, acting as teachers and guiding others to enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cineaste;Cineasta;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cineaste_DESC;The Cineasts believe in an esoteric pantheon of figures called Archetypes. The Archetypes are not people, but rather metaphysical principles, nameless ideals that embody the pinnacle of humanity. Only if the faithful follow the Hero's Journey through the lessons taught by the Haysian Gurus will they be able to avoid getting a rerun, and earn their place in the Hall of Fame. Embodying an archetype is the ultimate goal in every Cineast's life, aiming to walk the Walk of Fame alongside the great antediluvian sages which accomplished the same, becoming great examples for all to follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The newly-founded Church of Saint Thaddeus, a unification of the Coptic and Armenian Churches of the West Coast, soon elected a new Catholicos-Patriarch, restoring apostolic succession from Saint Thaddeus himself. It became a safe haven for the wayward Catholics and Protestants who had nobody to guide them in these troubling times. Even now, the Thaddean Church recognises the autonomous rites of the Catholics and Protestants, interdenominational cooperation paving the way to rebuild the world anew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

guadalupano_DESC;La Iglesia de Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe, known colloquially as the Guadalupan Church is a post-Event Catholic church founded in opposition to the official Catholic Church in Mexico, led by the Mexican Patriarch. After the Event the Archdiocese of Mexico was abolished, with the Patriarchate of Mexico founded in its place. The new Patriarchate soon started enacting controversial measures in order to prevent the Church's collapse, alienating many priests and bishops, who in turn elected their own Archbishop of Mexico to lead them.\nThe Patriarch of Mexico attempts to actively stamp out worship of folk saints, while the Guadalupanos believe the Church and the Archdiocese should have autonomy over canonisation of saints, at least until direct communion with the Pope is re-established. For this, Guadalupanos are denounced by the Patriarch as being idolatrous, as the Guadalupan Church sees nothing inherently wrong with the reverence of local saints, though they tend to be revered more as deities than saints, with intercession commonly being ignored among adherents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

blessing_way_DESC;The Diné believe that their ancestors passed through three different worlds before arriving to the current Fourth or Glittering World.

Humanity was created by the Changing Woman, who personifies the harmony of the universe, and her sons slew the monsters threatening the diyinii. The diyinii then taught the humans how to live in harmony with Mother Earth and Father Sky, and even the smallest insect was instrumental in shaping the Diné way of life. These beliefs center around the practise of ceremonial songs, in which their creation narratives are recited by dancers, and divided into two major ways. The first is the Blessing Way, Hózhóójí, which is used for healing and keeping the balance of the world, and the second is the Enemy Way, Ana'í Ndáá', used to protect from harmful spirits and lay them to rest. Other than that, the Diné have three major chants - the Holy Way for healing and attracting good forces, the Evil Way for exorcising evil and the Life Way for treating injuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Peyotism was founded long before the Event by the tribes of Oklahoma in order to combine the wise teachings of Christian preachers with the way of life of the native elders. Thus, Peyotism combines Christian morals, influenced by Protestantism, and worship of God and Jesus Christ, with many traditional ceremonies, such as the usage of peyote. The Peyotist god is called the Great Spirit or Great Mystery, and he is ever present in the lives of men, the Holy Spirit inhabiting every crevice and visions being received through the smoking of peyote. The Church has traditionally been divided between two main denominations, or "fireplaces" - the Half Moon fireplace and the Fire Cross fireplace. The Half Moon fireplace rejects many of the more Christian traditions, while the Fire Cross fireplace ceremonies frequently use Bibles, crosses, and Christian religious songs.;;;;;;;;;;;x

salihi_DESC;After the Event, many Muslims could not believe that such an apocalyptic thing could happen to the world without it being some sort of divine punishment. Some interpreted it as meaning that knoweldge of Islam has become progressively hidden in an age of ignorance, a new jahliyyah, and that this was all divine punishment. Thus when a figure of the name of Salih rose from the rubble of Dearborn claiming to be the infallible Mahdi sent to redeem Islam and unveil what was lost again, many listened. His incredible knoweldge of theology of seemingly all schools of Islam was uncommon in the post-Event age where most were illiterate and didn't have the time for religious practice as they tried to survive the apocalypse, baffling the Muslim community of Minnesota, which rallied under him. His popularity growing, he would establish a caliphate in the region, and spread his revivalist doctrine, which took influences of multiple schools of Islam of the Americas and attracted many of the local tribes. Salih would himself write over one hundred books on religious law during his conquests. Today, his community is still extant, and still uses his works, shortly before his death closing the Ijtihad of Islam, so as to prevent deviation from what he had restored. They regard Salih as infallible, having unveiled what had been lost during the Jahliyyah. They are still waiting to finally take the world out of ignorance. Though the Mahdi himself has died and his ancient conquests are shattered, many Muslims still believe his descendants will finally save the ummah and bring the world out of ignorance eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;x

The movement and the Church were founded before the Event in the United States after what is called the "Great Disappointment", a failed prediction of the Second Coming that tested the faith of many. Nonetheless, their belief of the imminent advent of Jesus Christ was not shaken, and the newly-founded Church massively grew over the years, surviving the Event. Official Adventist belief states that the Event was, in fact, not the prophesied Second Coming, but merely a warning sign. Thus, the Seventh-Day Adventist Church holds steadfast in their beliefs, more prepared than ever for the return of their saviour, after which the faithful will be taken to Heaven for a thousand years, and those who were not saved will cease to exist, leaving only the faithful to prosper on a renewed Earth.;;;;;;;;;;;x

As the former Music Capital of America, the city of Nashville gave birth to the Harmonics, who venerate the King of Graceland as their prophet. They clung to the Biblical passage describing God as "the Word", believing that voice and language was God's oldest and purest form, and that humans were made in God's image because they are able to best articulate his will through speech and song.;;;;;;;;;;;x

emmaean_reformed_DESC;To the Emmaeans, the apocalypse started long before any man was born, and will continue long into the future. Emmaeans believe that time is a cycle: just as the old books of Genesis speak of the flood, so does the Event speak of the flood that destroyed the Old World and left humanity to rebuild. The oracles and judges of the Emmaean faith profess a belief that the next apocalypse is to mirror the last, the first resulting in a total rebirth of the world, as predicted by the very same sages of the ancient past. It was during this previous apocalypse that He Cloaked in Blood took it upon himself to save mankind. Many rejected him however, and were left behind, the Almighty Saviour swearing to come back for them in the next apocalypse. The souls of men are destined to be reborn constantly until He Cloaked in Blood saves them from the endless cycle of time. Thus, the Event heralds his next return, and the fulfilling of Revelation, where one's immortal soul may rejoin the Heavenly Host and be reborn to a New Eden, while the faithless are to once again stay behind on a ravaged Earth and await the next Revelation. The Emmaeans now patiently await the return of Him Cloaked in Blood, not beholden to any bishops or academies - the faithful live simple, orderly lives in service of the Almighty Saviour. He will inevitably arrive, as he did many cycles before, and many will reject him, proving mankind's free will can reject paradise even in the end of days. The gifts of His Holy Spirit prove, however, that mankind is not abandoned yet. The mighty river that once flooded the world and killed many is now the same river that gives life and feeds many, and the same winds that drained a man of his blood now give him life. All this is proof of the mercy of Him Cloaked in Blood, who will love humanity endlessly, and try time and time again to show them truth, no matter how many times he is rejected.;;;;;;;;;;;x

abolitionist_DESC;Though the churches of the Free Baptist Convention are peaceful, espousing ideals of justice and equality, there are those who believe they are too pacifistic, too passive in the fight for justice. Many who hold these beliefs have begun to call themselves Abolitionists, calling upon all Christian faithful to "fight for what is right". The Abolitionists are heavily influenced by folk figures such as the martyrs John Brown and Nat Turner, and are unified in their endless crusade against all forms of inequality - most notably racial and class, and most frequently by means of incredible violence. Abolitionist doctrine is thus heavily denounced by the mainstream Free Baptist churches, who claim that such a response against the purported evils of the world is equal to stooping down to their level, only serving to continue the cycle of hatred established during mankind's earliest years. The Abolitionists, however, are not willing to budge, and are generally completely unwilling to engage in dialogue with anyone they consider exploitative of the weak and downtrodden, be it entire faiths or kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;x

cowboy_buddhist_DESC;The origin of this irregular faith can be traced to various American interpretations of different oriental faiths as well as indigenous beliefs. Some sages recall ancient texts from a foreign land, which contained wisdom relating to surviving the physical and spiritual obstacles warriors face, which gradually spread over the centuries - ancient principles of eastern spirituality, particular mindfulness, non-attachment, and compassion, the faith weaving them with the ideals of self-reliance, freedom, and respect for nature. Individual followers practice non-attachment as a form of existential freedom, and compassion as a form of brotherhood. Practitioners meditate in the saddle, when practicing martial activities, and attain a clarity of mind and discipline which allows them to continually improve themselves. The core of the Starry Eyed Path offers a spiritual journey through which enlightenment is possible through the display and encouraging of discipline, resilience, and the upholding of the noble, protective warrior ethos its followers champion.\nWhile the faith's followers truly view life itself as a bringer of conflict, they do not crave violence, rather, as a fundamental part of humanity, it is something to be mastered, and is a testament to one's strength in regards to how they approach it. To the Star Riders, the Sky Father is the ultimate patriarch, but otherwise distant: while he may have made man in his own image, a great number of powerful gods and immortals are honored by the followers of the Art of War, with each clan having their own array of notable figures which are worshipped and honoured, as there is no better method to honor the Sky Father than to leave him undisturbed. Today, the martial aptitude of the nomadic clans and cloistered villages which have fostered the Starry Eyed Path are well known throughout the American Midwest, although their tenuous respect for other faiths have caused conflicts they cannot claim to have won.;;;;;;;;;;;x

postdiluvian_DESC;The world before was a land of horrors, with every king, judge, and merchant tyrannical and cruel, gaining wealth and power by tormenting those who retained their faith in the face of the hardships inflicted upon them. The wickedness of the lords of the Earth caused such great suffering, and God, in his wisdom, punished every nation of man through the means of a great flood, which washed away all the evils that set brothers upon brothers, those who gained power by dividing God's design through vile plots. Upon the high mounds and mountains, the crowds of those who once hungered as slaves and beggars in their own lands, and all others who held faith close to their hearts waited for generations to receive the ancient laws God once granted Noah, forming a final covenant with all mankind, one uniting all men and women once again as equals in the eyes of the Lord.\nThe Postdiluvians maintain that all men alive today are descendants of those deserving of God's mercy, and that all men are once again worthy of receiving his gifts. As they believe all their wayward cousins are righteous, at least compared to those who came before, they remain content worshipping God's wondrous creation and upholding the sacred laws passed down from father to son. However, they remain keen to ensure that no tyrants emerge among the wayward, knowing what has come before and what is worth preserving.\nPostdiluvians traditionally honour God's creations through communal religious ceremonies, in which sacred herbs known to promote gifts of the Holy Spirit are consumed in order to inspire transcendent states, as per the needs of the flock, and communities engage in the construction of elaborate earthwork monuments meant to honour God and provide a space for major ceremonies, often including forms of pageantry. Many cultivate relationships with the land itself, believing that, as God is omnipresent, everything in God's creation is worthy of worship, being a place for all the disfavored people of the Old World to live as though the demonic forces of the back-then never existed, and the wisest among them are often inductees into the mystical arts.;;;;;;;;;;;x

On the other side of Lake Michigan, however, prevails a different story, in which the Earth Mother, Gaia, created the first bloom of life on a barren planet, and man alongside it, who was given intelligence to enjoy the beauty of the garden around them.\nHowever, they were soon taught by Father Industry the secrets of the Black Gold, the primordial fuel of the Earth, and it was abused to create great steel skeletons and machines of destruction until the rivers around them laid polluted, the forests desecrated, and the spirits of the world went into hiding. Man retreated into his ivory tower, destroying to his heart's desire, until his precious Black Gold completely ran out. Their machines became lifeless, their cities collapsed and became buried under dirt and sand, and the individuality of man was destroyed, with the vast majority perishing, not knowing how to survive in the world they were created in.\nJust as it began, nature ruled the world once again. The faithful of the Mother now swear to live in harmony with the world around them, worshipping Gaia who created them, the sanctity of birth, and the spirits who have since returned to their ancient homes.;;;;;;;;;;;x

According to legend, Ludd was just a lowly worker in the steel-carved cities of industrial Earth, until he was one day approached in person by the Great Mother herself. Gaia told Ludd to take up arms and retake the Earth back into the hands of the righteous, gifting him a sword powerful enough to cut through steel and rust.\nThus, Ludd and his most loyal followers sabotaged all corners of man's world, burning down manufactories, cutting down towers of steel, and inspiring the workers and peasants of the steel cities to revolt against their overlords until the flames burned out. Inspired by these heroic tales, the faithful Luddites of the new era are dedicated to preventing man's hubris from ever tearing down the sacred nature around them, making sure the world never requires another Ludd to save it.;;;;;;;;;;;x

edenite_DESC;In the desolate wastes of the post-Event world, the Christian faithful held out. Even against the red plague, starvation, war, idolatry and paganism, the faithful of Christ the Martyr held strong in their beliefs and patiently awaited the return of their Lord to bring them up into Heaven and smite the unbelievers. Except their Saviour never came. There was only one explanation, said Reverend Joshua Whitefield - the Saviour of Mankind will not return until God's green Earth is cleansed. Christ Almighty had judged man from afar, and deemed him too sinful, too cynical, and not worthy of his divine grace. The Second Coming is impossible as long as the world is infested with all those who have turned away from God, and have subsequently been abandoned by him.\nThe sick, the poor, the unsightly, and all the unbelievers comprise the wicked eschelons of society that are too sinful to be rewarded by God, and have no place in the Kingdom of God on Earth. So, the Edenite faithful have taken it on themselves to spread the Divine Gospel to all those who live their lives in the Lord's shadow, be it by kindness or by force, for as long as they plague the Earth they will never be able to herald a new Kingdom of god - a New Eden.;;;;;;;;;;;x

The rest of the world may have forgotten their oaths, but the loyal knights of Canada have not. Even if their divine creators are no longer here, their chivalric spirit lives on.

santeria_DESC;Originally emerged prior to the event through the Synchronization of the Yoruba beliefs of the African slaves with the Catholicism of the Spaniards, Santeria has experienced a major syncretism with Catholicism after the event having absorbed the Catholic survivors with the collapse of the Catholic Church in Cuba. This religion believes in the existence of a supreme and universal tripartite god from which everything is derived, being its 3 aspects: Olodumaré, the Father, Olorun, the Holy Spirit, and Olofin, the Son. Although Olodumaré created the universe and was frequently involved in the past, today he no longer intervenes directly in the world, leaving his son Olofin in charge with the help of other intermediaries. This is why the followers of this religion tend instead to worship mainly Olofin, their ancestors' spirits (known as Egun) and the saints or ochas. And although there are probably dozens or hundreds of saints, they worship mainly the seven most important ones, the Seven African Potencies, considered by some as facets of the creator God and by others as Olofin's helpers in governing the world.;;;;;;;;;;;x

madonnite_DESC;The Mississippi River has always held special significance to the middle of old America, giving life and wealth to communities on Her waters and the waters of Her tributaries. Because of this, many believe the river to be more than just that, lending it an air of sacredness to peoples of all creeds who live within Her reach. The most popular expression of this belief is the worship of the Sacred Madonna, a goddess who gave life to the world by creating the river and many others like it. Over the years, a pantheon has developed around the Sacred Madonna, including the Heavenly Father who created Earth and the realm of spirit, and the Good Shepherd, Her son who leads the souls of the dead to the afterlife, and a pantheon consisting of many angels who come from old scripture, popular lore, and the beliefs of their neighbors.\nOriginally, the Madonnite faith was localised to parts of old Illinoy, but with the conquests of Ishmael Arthur and the establishment of the Second Mississippi Empire it has since spread far and wide. With the expansion of the faith also came its restructuring, and Ishmael enlisted the help of the priest Joseph to codify the Madonnite beliefs and create a hierarchy for the faith, with Joseph being the first to claim the title of the Oracle of the Sacred Madonna. Despite the newfound hierarchy, the faith much like the old city states that practise it kept much of its independent and divided nature, with the Oracle not having nearly as much authority as the heads of other faiths. Now that the Empire has fractured, the spread of the Madonnite faith has stalled, though if a strong enough prince were to rise up it could very well continue its march along the banks of the holy waters.;;;;;;;;;;;x

The common man and woman live in constant fear of the tyranny employed by the servants of those who wish to call themselves righteous, or who uphold the values of kings and priests from far-off lands for the sake of extracting all they can gain from the enslaved. There are many who would rejoice if these empires were to be replaced with a more benevolent government, though such a thing may seem fantastical to those who suffer under the whip and lash. There exist whispers of a Golden Age of Piracy, in which absolute freedom from all forms of tyranny once existed, solely due to the actions of esteemed men and women which the world deigned to call Pirates. The promised land these Pirates reigned over was Libertalia, a golden kingdom in which all men were free to do as they wished unfettered, defended by the most cunning and brave among the Pirates themselves.\nThe Golden Age has long since ended, Libertalia becoming a legend, but the Libertalians have yet to cease in their struggle for liberty and self-determinism for all who choose to pursue it against a hostile world. The Libertalian faithful promote personal freedom in all respects, and are keen to break all those shackles which tie good folk to unjust rulers.

citrus_scientology_DESC;The Rapturist Convention is an organisation of Evangelical churches following Scientologist religious doctrine. They believe that God brought the ancient humans to Earth from space 75 million years ago, at which point he called a great flood. Almost all the ancient humans perished in the flood as punishment for their sin, except for the few that were saved by Noah and his ark. From there, humanity repopulated, but the souls of all the people who died in the flood lingered on in the material world, not being pure enough to ascend to Heaven. These souls affect the souls of all living men, and it is now up to the faithful alive today to atone for millions of years of sin, so they may be able to ascend to Heaven when Jesus returns at the Fountain of Youth in his divine spacecraft.;;;;;;;;;;;x

israelite_DESC;Calling themselves "yehudim", the Israelites practice a religion that they describe as "messianic Judaism". They consider themselves to be Jews that believe in Jesus Christ as the prophesied Messiah and the Son of God. They consider the entire Bible to be sacred, and they also claim to be Children of Israel, God's chosen people. The Israelites also believe that God is a trinity, consisting of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. As well as Christian beliefs, they also affirm the Shema, use Hebrew as a liturgical language, and hold that the Torah and Tanakh are fully divine as well as the Bible, though acceptance of the Talmud and Jewish Oral law varies. These controversial positions put them inbetween Christianity and Judaism, representing both but not being claimed by either, though the Israelites are steadfast in their beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;x

televangelical_DESC;While the influence of charisms has been widely accepted in the greater Protestant world, there are those who believe charismatic gifts have been all but lost in the world created by the Event. Calling themselves "Televangelicals", these groups believe that charisms could be channelled through a holy device dubbed the "teevee", by which the Holy Spirit's divine gifts may be given to all faithful believers. However, mankind grew too greedy, each man channelling the teevee for hours every day, using the gift of God's love for his own selfish indulgences. Thus, the Lord's heavenly energy stopped flowing, and mankind was struck down for its avarice. Now, the Televangelical priests gather and pray in front of the teevees, hoping they may earn God's forgiveness and be given the gift of the Holy Spirit once again.;;;;;;;;;;;x

community_of_christ_DESC;The Community of Christ, or the Reorganised Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is a Mormon church that traces its roots back to the leadership of Joseph Smith's eldest son Joseph Smith III. While the fellow LDS faithful moved to what is now Deseret under the leadership of President Young, the Community of Christ stayed in the Midwest, where it reorganised itself. Adapting much more theologically liberal beliefs that align with contemporary mainline Protestant thought, the Community became the main source of shelter, charity, and most importantly, hope for the downtrodden of post-Event America. Slowly, but surely, the Community rebuilds old America, brick by brick, in worship of the Heavenly Father.;;;;;;;;;;;x

gibborim_DESC;At the dawn of time, when there was little in the world but mist and stone, there were giants who dwelt upon the Earth, who shaped the formless world with their cunning magics and sheer strength. As they whittled themselves to a mere scant few, those who survived this primordial conflict allotted to form great clans, and to eventually reap the harvest that they had sown, that being the nascent civilisations of Mankind. \nThese giants, the Gibborim, made themselves kings over Man, and they fathered sons and daughters: with time, the Gibborim left the mortal coil in search of a purpose or killed each other in search of power, leaving only their strongest children to reign over the world. Although these giants were few and lesser than their forefathers, their incredible power and personal magnetism made it a simple matter for them to lead Mankind towards a glorious Golden Age, where the god-kings of the world lived among mortals.\nThe Golden Age was doomed to fail, due to new and cowardly spirits. These spirits were cowards and tempted the weak Men who lacked the hearty, vigorous blood that pulsed through the veins of the giant-kin to worship them and subvert the great kingdoms of yore. Alas, the great dynasties fell one by one, until soon all Men worshipped gods that they could see only in their dreams, rather than at the helm of great nations. Those who still claim faint descent from the Gibborim have since reclaimed the name of their ancestors after the end of time, having reconstructed their collective identity as the heirs to the world-rulers in a time where the Gibborim hold more worldly power than they have had in thousands of years, no more regulated to old stories of trolls and ogres haunting the hills, or as hairy beasts scorned by the followers of the so-called true gods.\nEverything in Gibborim culture is based on bloodlines, as the inherent strength and spiritual capabilities of a Gibborim is directly proportional to how far removed he is perceived to be from one of the old dynasties, and anyone who would dare call themselves a Gibborim lord knows their entire lineage back to the comely mortals that their titanic ancestors engaged with. While all the old bloodlines are heavily diluted. The Gibborim, meanwhile, consider the right to consume human flesh as their birthright, as mankind is both provender and family to the great ones: the god-kings once slacked their thirsts in grand ceremonies, but the Gibborim now are content to consume the flesh of lesser men to ensure that their divine nature is obvious to all, as they are above all laws which stem from the teachings of ephemeral gods.;;;;;;;;;;;x

shangava_DESC;The Shangavasampradaya tradition of Caribbean Hinduism only formed after the Event shook the islands to their core. Shangavists worship Shango, the Yoruba god of thunder, as Para Brahman, the Supreme Being. Shangavist tradition states that Shiva was the original conception of Olodumaré, the Ultimate Reality, until he one day rebirthed himself as a mortal named Shango, becoming the King of Oyo, and ascending to divinity upon death. Now, Shango is worshipped as both the creator and the destroyer, and the source of all minor gods and orishas. He is authoritative and wrathful, being the god of destruction, but also the creator of all love and life, and his followers believe that a life in service of Shango will lead them to escape the cycle of rebirth and be reunited with their god.;;;;;;;;;;;x

neovedantic_DESC;The Hare Krishna movement traces its originis back to the Old World, in the far away land of Bharat. The bhaktas, as they call themselves, are devout followers of the god Krishna, the azure-skinned Hindu god of love and compassion. Krishna is worshipped as Svayam Bhagavan, the Supreme Being, and is cherished as the ultimate creator. They teach that Krishna is the source of all other gods and avatars, including the Trimurti, Jesus, and Lady Columbia. To them, Krishna is God, and the bhaktas worship him in magnanimous festivals filled with all forms of singing, dancing, and chanting.\nThe only exception is their dual worship of Radha, Krishna's faithful wife. While Krishna represents all the masculine aspects of the universe, Radha represents all the feminine, and together they form the cosmic balance between the male and female realities of the world. The bhaktas believe that reality is ultimately an illusion, and a pious person will return to the source of all energy - brahman - upon escaping the cycle of death and rebirth. Though very far away from their homeland, they are still devoted to preaching and spreading the love of Krishna wherever they go, backed by an extensive organisation of priests and gurus.;;;;;;;;;;;x

quixtiano_DESC;The indigenous peoples of central Mexico have been firmly Catholic for centuries before the Event, even if the influence of their old gods and ancestral folklore never really went away. Many traditions have died out since then, new ones taking their place, creating a faith that attempts to explain Christian beliefs through myths as old as the religion itself. The most important divinity is Our Precious Mother, Tonantzin, who is the Blessed Virgin of Guadalupe, and the mother of God and all Mexicans. God Himself consists of a duality, one side being the Father, Tloque nahaque, who is the Lifegiver and the creator of the world, and the other being the Son, Quixto, whose prophesied coming signals the end of the current cycle and the coming of the next. Together they form the One God, Icelteotl, who is simultaneously he who creates and he who destroys the world, and his temper is only controlled by the love and care of the mother Tonantzin.\nMan's destiny is decided at birth by a battle between Icelteotl and the Devil, Tlacatecolotl. The victor determines whether the child receives a good shadow, becoming destined to succeed in life and ascend to Heaven, or a heavy shadow, being destined to sinning and going to Hell. Men who die in battle and women who die in childbirth go directly to Heaven regardless, while the souls of those who drowned go to an earthly paradise inhabited by the Rain Dwarfs. The Quixtianos believe in three heavens: a flower garden for children, a heaven for adults, and a kingdom for God and his Saints. The Saints have become much resembling minor deities on their own, who lose their temper, take revenge and strike deals with mortals, their images being dressed and worshiped as divine personages. Hell, called Mictlan, is ruled by demons called "pingos", who burn wood under the damned souls and sting them with pitchforks. Only those accused of murder and nahualism are condemned to it.;;;;;;;;;;;x

They believe that soon, the status quo of the world will be uprooted and destroyed by the return of Archangel Michael, the heavenly form of Jesus Christ, who is the son of God. With his Host of 144,000 kings in Heaven, he will wage the final world war called Armageddon, delivered by God, which the Witnesses see as a rescue operation for Jehovah's people.

marked_DESC;It is known among many that Cain slew his brother Abel. However, few would identify all of humanity as the descendants of Cain. The Marked do exactly that, and consider all remaining men who survived the Event to be those who were damned by the laws written before the creation of man. Those who believe themselves to carry the Mark of Cain understand that they are doomed to an eternity of pain at the hands of devils regardless of their actions. Those among the Marked adhere to the belief that they are, in essence, damned from the moment they are born, as God's elect have all perished and only the dredges of mankind remain, those designated to be tormented, providing a model to define themselves against for those with the true capacity to repent for their sins.\nThe only true succor the Marked hold dear regarding the futility of their existence lies in the core of their theology: while Heaven is barred from them and spreading the gospel is futile, as no grace will ever be given to the damned, a wholly pure and simple life, one dedicated to repenting for the sins of existence all men commit, may allow for a soul to be annihilated upon death, or are at least allowed to 'sleep', rather than be tormented for all eternity. Accordingly, the Marked partake in numerous ritual practices to separate themselves from and appease the evil spirits of the world, while maintaining what little spiritual purity their impure existences can maintain, all for the possibility that they may avoid eternal damnation through destroying all which may fetter them to the demonic forces tied deeply to the physical world, and pray fervently that God pays little heed to those imperfections they themselves have which damned all of their forefathers.;;;;;;;;;;;x

Arriving east in the land of Ohio, their preaching very quickly turned to total war, as they were met with fierce raiders from across the Ohio river. Drenched in blood and painted demonic colours, the kidnappings of innocent Ohioan villagers would grow in number, until one day the newly formed Order of Watchers fortified the entire length of the river, and seized control of the Catholic Church in Ohio.

insular_DESC;With the Event in full swing, Christianity in Canada found itself in crisis. From the first days of the end, the priests and bishops of the Atlantic coast knew the faith is collapsing, with many losing faith in the Lord and many more finding new faith in pagan chants and heathenism. Nonetheless, as the well preserved Archives of Halifax bear witness, the Year 2084 marks the first Council of Halifax, in which the most esteemed priests of the Catholic Church of Canada, the United Church of Canada, and the Anglican Church of Canada looked past their petty ecclesiastical differences.\nThe final decision of the Council was a huge tide of change. The three churches would establish full communion, contrary to the classic definition of the term, and completely reform the governance of Christianity in Canada, permitting local churches to control entire parishes in order to safeguard the faith. Soon, the local bishops would become priest-kings, and the local churches would grow out into parish-monasteries, with monks and nuns forming essential parts of the new administrations.\nA new central body was founded in the Council - the Insular Episcopal Order. However, it was not to oversee each bishopric directly, but merely serve as a holy order of monk-warriors to defend the faith from pagan incursions. Now, the Christians of the North Atlantic live relatively peaceful lives, with Catholics and Protestants sitting in the same churches, performing the same rituals, and praying to the same Lord.\nWhat started out as a shaky, desperate relationship united in faith yet further disunited in contradictions soon grew to outlast many who attempted to do the same. However, piracy has always been an issue for the icy waters of the Atlantic, and with spreading rumours of an immortal empire across the seas coming to claim their souls, only time will tell if the new age of monasticism in the Americas will last.;;;;;;;;;x
