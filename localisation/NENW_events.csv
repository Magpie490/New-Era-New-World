EVTNAME_triumphant_2;The Age of Aggression;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_triumphant_1;For the first time in many years, the battlefields of the old Frontier are silent. It is said that the Triumphant hordes are once more retreating to lick their wounds, their numbers exhausted after a lifetime of war, and their Lord's heavenly army swollen with new recruits. Some even go as far to say the only reason for the retreat is that they ran out of great warriors to triumph over.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_triumphant_2;The sound of trumpets and distant marching reverberates across the old Frontier as the Triumphant hordes once again prepare for war. It is said they will stop at nothing short of total defeat of their enemies, each soldier aiming to prove himself in the eyes of their Lord, hoping to join his host in Heaven. Whether or not the rumours of their zeal are true, it is without a doubt that war will grasp the dredges of poor old Columbia.;;;;;;;;;x
